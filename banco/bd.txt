MY
LORD,
You
will
perhaps
wonder
that
an
obscure
person,
who
has
not
the
honour
to
be
known
to
your
lordship,
should
presume
to
address
you
in
this
manner.
But
that
a
man
who
has
written
something
with
a
design
to
promote
Useful
Knowledge
and
Religion
in
the
world
should
make
choice
of
your
lordship
for
his
patron,
will
not
be
thought
strange
by
any
one
that
is
not
altogether
unacquainted
with
the
present
state
of
the
church
and
learning,
and
consequently
ignorant
how
great
an
ornament
and
support
you
are
to
both.
Yet,
nothing
could
have
induced
me
to
make
you
this
present
of
my
poor
endeavours,
were
I
not
encouraged
by
that
candour
and
native
goodness
which
is
so
bright
a
part
in
your
lordship's
character.
I
might
add,
my
lord,
that
the
extraordinary
favour
and
bounty
you
have
been
pleased
to
show
towards
our
Society
gave
me
hopes
you
would
not
be
unwilling
to
countenance
the
studies
of
one
of
its
members.
These
considerations
determined
me
to
lay
this
treatise
at
your
lordship's
feet,
and
the
rather
because
I
was
ambitious
to
have
it
known
that
I
am
with
the
truest
and
most
profound
respect,
on
account
of
that
learning
and
virtue
which
the
world
so
justly
admires
in
your
lordship,
MY
LORD,
Your
lordship's
most
humble
and
most
devoted
servant,

BERKELEY
PREFACE
WHAT
I
here
make
public
has,
after
a
long
and
scrupulous
inquiry,
seemed
to
me
evidently
true
and
not
unuseful
to
be
known-
particularly
to
those
who
are
tainted
with
Scepticism,
or
want
a
demonstration
of
the
existence
and
immateriality
of
God,
or
the
natural
immortality
of
the
soul.
Whether
it
be
so
or
no
I
am
content
the
reader
should
impartially
examine;
since
I
do
not
think
myself
any
farther
concerned
for
the
success
of
what
I
have
written
than
as
it
is
agreeable
to
truth.
But,
to
the
end
this
may
not
suffer,
I
make
it
my
request
that
the
reader
suspend
his
judgment
till
he
has
once
at
least
read
the
whole
through
with
that
degree
of
attention
and
thought
which
the
subject-matter
shall
seem
to
deserve.
For,
as
there
are
some
passages
that,
taken
by
themselves,
are
very
liable
(nor
could
it
be
remedied)
to
gross
misinterpretation,
and
to
be
charged
with
most
absurd
consequences,
which,
nevertheless,
upon
an
entire
perusal
will
appear
not
to
follow
from
them;
so
likewise,
though
the
whole
should
be
read
over,
yet,
if
this
be
done
transiently,
it
is
very
probable
my
sense
may
be
mistaken;
but
to
a
thinking
reader,
I
flatter
myself
it
will
be
throughout
clear
and
obvious.
As
for
the
characters
of
novelty
and
singularity
which
some
of
the
following
notions
may
seem
to
bear,
it
is,
I
hope,
needless
to
make
any
apology
on
that
account.
He
must
surely
be
either
very
weak,
or
very
little
acquainted
with
the
sciences,
who
shall
reject
a
truth
that
is
capable
of
demonstration,
for
no
other
reason
but
because
it
is
newly
known,
and
contrary
to
the
prejudices
of
mankind.
Thus
much
I
thought
fit
to
premise,
in
order
to
prevent,
if
possible,
the
hasty
censures
of
a
sort
of
men
who
are
too
apt
to
condemn
an
opinion
before
they
rightly
comprehend
it.
INTRODUCTION
1.
Philosophy
being
nothing
else
but
the
study
of
wisdom
and
truth,
it
may
with
reason
be
expected
that
those
who
have
spent
most
time
and
pains
in
it
should
enjoy
a
greater
calm
and
serenity
of
mind,
a
greater
clearness
and
evidence
of
knowledge,
and
be
less
disturbed
with
doubts
and
difficulties
than
other
men.
Yet
so
it
is,
we
see
the
illiterate
bulk
of
mankind
that
walk
the
high-road
of
plain
common
sense,
and
are
governed
by
the
dictates
of
nature,
for
the
most
part
easy
and
undisturbed.
To
them
nothing
that
is
familiar
appears
unaccountable
or
difficult
to
comprehend.
They
complain
not
of
any
want
of
evidence
in
their
senses,
and
are
out
of
all
danger
of
becoming
Sceptics.
But
no
sooner
do
we
depart
from
sense
and
instinct
to
follow
the
light
of
a
superior
principle,
to
reason,
meditate,
and
reflect
on
the
nature
of
things,
but
a
thousand
scruples
spring
up
in
our
minds
concerning
those
things
which
before
we
seemed
fully
to
comprehend.
Prejudices
and
errors
of
sense
do
from
all
parts
discover
themselves
to
our
view;
and,
endeavouring
to
correct
these
by
reason,
we
are
insensibly
drawn
into
uncouth
paradoxes,
difficulties,
and
inconsistencies,
which
multiply
and
grow
upon
us
as
we
advance
in
speculation,
till
at
length,
having
wandered
through
many
intricate
mazes,
we
find
ourselves
just
where
we
were,
or,
which
is
worse,
sit
down
in
a
forlorn
Scepticism.
2.
The
cause
of
this
is
thought
to
be
the
obscurity
of
things,
or
the
natural
weakness
and
imperfection
of
our
understandings.
It
is
said,
the
faculties
we
have
are
few,
and
those
designed
by
nature
for
the
support
and
comfort
of
life,
and
not
to
penetrate
into
the
inward
essence
and
constitution
of
things.
Besides,
the
mind
of
man
being
finite,
when
it
treats
of
things
which
partake
of
infinity,
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
it
run
into
absurdities
and
contradictions,
out
of
which
it
is
impossible
it
should
ever
extricate
itself,
it
being
of
the
nature
of
infinite
not
to
be
comprehended
by
that
which
is
finite.
3.
But,
perhaps,
we
may
be
too
partial
to
ourselves
in
placing
the
fault
originally
in
our
faculties,
and
not
rather
in
the
wrong
use
we
make
of
them.
It
is
a
hard
thing
to
suppose
that
right
deductions
from
true
principles
should
ever
end
in
consequences
which
cannot
be
maintained
or
made
consistent.
We
should
believe
that
God
has
dealt
more
bountifully
with
the
sons
of
men
than
to
give
them
a
strong
desire
for
that
knowledge
which
he
had
placed
quite
out
of
their
reach.
This
were
not
agreeable
to
the
wonted
indulgent
methods
of
Providence,
which,
whatever
appetites
it
may
have
implanted
in
the
creatures,
doth
usually
furnish
them
with
such
means
as,
if
rightly
made
use
of,
will
not
fail
to
satisfy
them.
Upon
the
whole,
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
far
greater
part,
if
not
all,
of
those
difficulties
which
have
hitherto
amused
philosophers,
and
blocked
up
the
way
to
knowledge,
are
entirely
owing
to
ourselves-
that
we
have
first
raised
a
dust
and
then
complain
we
cannot
see.
4.
My
purpose
therefore
is,
to
try
if
I
can
discover
what
those
Principles
are
which
have
introduced
all
that
doubtfulness
and
uncertainty,
those
absurdities
and
contradictions,
into
the
several
sects
of
philosophy;
insomuch
that
the
wisest
men
have
thought
our
ignorance
incurable,
conceiving
it
to
arise
from
the
natural
dulness
and
limitation
of
our
faculties.
And
surely
it
is
a
work
well
deserving
our
pains
to
make
a
strict
inquiry
concerning
the
First
Principles
of
Human
Knowledge,
to
sift
and
examine
them
on
all
sides,
especially
since
there
may
be
some
grounds
to
suspect
that
those
lets
and
difficulties,
which
stay
and
embarrass
the
mind
in
its
search
after
truth,
do
not
spring
from
any
darkness
and
intricacy
in
the
objects,
or
natural
defect
in
the
understanding,
so
much
as
from
false
Principles
which
have
been
insisted
on,
and
might
have
been
avoided.
5.
How
difficult
and
discouraging
soever
this
attempt
may
seem,
when
I
consider
how
many
great
and
extraordinary
men
have
gone
before
me
in
the
like
designs,
yet
I
am
not
without
some
hopes-
upon
the
consideration
that
the
largest
views
are
not
always
the
clearest,
and
that
he
who
is
short-sighted
will
be
obliged
to
draw
the
object
nearer,
and
may,
perhaps,
by
a
close
and
narrow
survey,
discern
that
which
had
escaped
far
better
eyes.
6.
In
order
to
prepare
the
mind
of
the
reader
for
the
easier
conceiving
what
follows,
it
is
proper
to
premise
somewhat,
by
way
of
Introduction,
concerning
the
nature
and
abuse
of
Language.
But
the
unravelling
this
matter
leads
me
in
some
measure
to
anticipate
my
design,
by
taking
notice
of
what
seems
to
have
had
a
chief
part
in
rendering
speculation
intricate
and
perplexed,
and
to
have
occasioned
innumerable
errors
and
difficulties
in
almost
all
parts
of
knowledge.
And
that
is
the
opinion
that
the
mind
hath
a
power
of
framing
abstract
ideas
or
notions
of
things.
He
who
is
not
a
perfect
stranger
to
the
writings
and
disputes
of
philosophers
must
needs
acknowledge
that
no
small
part
of
them
are
spent
about
abstract
ideas.
These
are
in
a
more
especial
manner
thought
to
be
the
object
of
those
sciences
which
go
by
the
name
of
Logic
and
Metaphysics,
and
of
all
that
which
passes
under
the
notion
of
the
most
abstracted
and
sublime
learning,
in
all
which
one
shall
scarce
find
any
question
handled
in
such
a
manner
as
does
not
suppose
their
existence
in
the
mind,
and
that
it
is
well
acquainted
with
them.
7.
It
is
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
qualities
or
modes
of
things
do
never
really
exist
each
of
them
apart
by
itself,
and
separated
from
all
others,
but
are
mixed,
as
it
were,
and
blended
together,
several
in
the
same
object.
But,
we
are
told,
the
mind
being
able
to
consider
each
quality
singly,
or
abstracted
from
those
other
qualities
with
which
it
is
united,
does
by
that
means
frame
to
itself
abstract
ideas.
For
example,
there
is
perceived
by
sight
an
object
extended,
coloured,
and
moved:
this
mixed
or
compound
idea
the
mind
resolving
into
its
simple,
constituent
parts,
and
viewing
each
by
itself,
exclusive
of
the
rest,
does
frame
the
abstract
ideas
of
extension,
colour,
and
motion.
Not
that
it
is
possible
for
colour
or
motion
to
exist
without
extension;
but
only
that
the
mind
can
frame
to
itself
by
abstraction
the
idea
of
colour
exclusive
of
extension,
and
of
motion
exclusive
of
both
colour
and
extension.
8.
Again,
the
mind
having
observed
that
in
the
particular
extensions
perceived
by
sense
there
is
something
common
and
alike
in
all,
and
some
other
things
peculiar,
as
this
or
that
figure
or
magnitude,
which
distinguish
them
one
from
another;
it
considers
apart
or
singles
out
by
itself
that
which
is
common,
making
thereof
a
most
abstract
idea
of
extension,
which
is
neither
line,
surface,
nor
solid,
nor
has
any
figure
or
magnitude,
but
is
an
idea
entirely
prescinded
from
all
these.
So
likewise
the
mind,
by
leaving
out
of
the
particular
colours
perceived
by
sense
that
which
distinguishes
them
one
from
another,
and
retaining
that
only
which
is
common
to
all,
makes
an
idea
of
colour
in
abstract
which
is
neither
red,
nor
blue,
nor
white,
nor
any
other
determinate
colour.
And,
in
like
manner,
by
considering
motion
abstractedly
not
only
from
the
body
moved,
but
likewise
from
the
figure
it
describes,
and
all
particular
directions
and
velocities,
the
abstract
idea
of
motion
is
framed;
which
equally
corresponds
to
all
particular
motions
whatsoever
that
may
be
perceived
by
sense.
9.
And
as
the
mind
frames
to
itself
abstract
ideas
of
qualities
or
modes,
so
does
it,
by
the
same
precision
or
mental
separation,
attain
abstract
ideas
of
the
more
compounded
beings
which
include
several
coexistent
qualities.
For
example,
the
mind
having
observed
that
Peter,
James,
and
John
resemble
each
other
in
certain
common
agreements
of
shape
and
other
qualities,
leaves
out
of
the
complex
or
compounded
idea
it
has
of
Peter,
James,
and
any
other
particular
man,
that
which
is
peculiar
to
each,
retaining
only
what
is
common
to
all,
and
so
makes
an
abstract
idea
wherein
all
the
particulars
equally
partake-
abstracting
entirely
from
and
cutting
off
all
those
circumstances
and
differences
which
might
determine
it
to
any
particular
existence.
And
after
this
manner
it
is
said
we
come
by
the
abstract
idea
of
man,
or,
if
you
please,
humanity,
or
human
nature;
wherein
it
is
true
there
is
included
colour,
because
there
is
no
man
but
has
some
colour,
but
then
it
can
be
neither
white,
nor
black,
nor
any
particular
colour,
because
there
is
no
one
particular
colour
wherein
all
men
partake.
So
likewise
there
is
included
stature,
but
then
it
is
neither
tall
stature,
nor
low
stature,
nor
yet
middle
stature,
but
something
abstracted
from
all
these.
And
so
of
the
rest.
Moreover,
their
being
a
great
variety
of
other
creatures
that
partake
in
some
parts,
but
not
all,
of
the
complex
idea
of
man,
the
mind,
leaving
out
those
parts
which
are
peculiar
to
men,
and
retaining
those
only
which
are
common
to
all
the
living
creatures,
frames
the
idea
of
animal,
which
abstracts
not
only
from
all
particular
men,
but
also
all
birds,
beasts,
fishes,
and
insects.
The
constituent
parts
of
the
abstract
idea
of
animal
are
body,
life,
sense,
and
spontaneous
motion.
By
body
is
meant
body
without
any
particular
shape
or
figure,
there
being
no
one
shape
or
figure
common
to
all
animals,
without
covering,
either
of
hair,
or
feathers,
or
scales,
&c.,
nor
yet
naked:
hair,
feathers,
scales,
and
nakedness
being
the
distinguishing
properties
of
particular
animals,
and
for
that
reason
left
out
of
the
abstract
idea.
Upon
the
same
account
the
spontaneous
motion
must
be
neither
walking,
nor
flying,
nor
creeping;
it
is
nevertheless
a
motion,
but
what
that
motion
is
it
is
not
easy
to
conceive.
10.
Whether
others
have
this
wonderful
faculty
of
abstracting
their
ideas,
they
best
can
tell:
for
myself,
I
find
indeed
I
have
a
faculty
of
imagining,
or
representing
to
myself,
the
ideas
of
those
particular
things
I
have
perceived,
and
of
variously
compounding
and
dividing
them.
I
can
imagine
a
man
with
two
heads,
or
the
upper
parts
of
a
man
joined
to
the
body
of
a
horse.
I
can
consider
the
hand,
the
eye,
the
nose,
each
by
itself
abstracted
or
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
body.
But
then
whatever
hand
or
eye
I
imagine,
it
must
have
some
particular
shape
and
colour.
Likewise
the
idea
of
man
that
I
frame
to
myself
must
be
either
of
a
white,
or
a
black,
or
a
tawny,
a
straight,
or
a
crooked,
a
tall,
or
a
low,
or
a
middle-sized
man.
I
cannot
by
any
effort
of
thought
conceive
the
abstract
idea
above
described.
And
it
is
equally
impossible
for
me
to
form
the
abstract
idea
of
motion
distinct
from
the
body
moving,
and
which
is
neither
swift
nor
slow,
curvilinear
nor
rectilinear;
and
the
like
may
be
said
of
all
other
abstract
general
ideas
whatsoever.
To
be
plain,
I
own
myself
able
to
abstract
in
one
sense,
as
when
I
consider
some
particular
parts
or
qualities
separated
from
others,
with
which,
though
they
are
united
in
some
object,
yet
it
is
possible
they
may
really
exist
without
them.
But
I
deny
that
I
can
abstract
from
one
another,
or
conceive
separately,
those
qualities
which
it
is
impossible
should
exist
so
separated;
or
that
I
can
frame
a
general
notion,
by
abstracting
from
particulars
in
the
manner
aforesaid-
which
last
are
the
two
proper
acceptations
of
abstraction.
And
there
are
grounds
to
think
most
men
will
acknowledge
themselves
to
be
in
my
case.
The
generality
of
men
which
are
simple
and
illiterate
never
pretend
to
abstract
notions.
It
is
said
they
are
difficult
and
not
to
be
attained
without
pains
and
study;
we
may
therefore
reasonably
conclude
that,
if
such
there
be,
they
are
confined
only
to
the
learned.
11.
I
proceed
to
examine
what
can
be
alleged
in
defence
of
the
doctrine
of
abstraction,
and
try
if
I
can
discover
what
it
is
that
inclines
the
men
of
speculation
to
embrace
an
opinion
so
remote
from
common
sense
as
that
seems
to
be.
There
has
been
a
late
deservedly
esteemed
philosopher
who,
no
doubt,
has
given
it
very
much
countenance,
by
seeming
to
think
the
having
abstract
general
ideas
is
what
puts
the
widest
difference
in
point
of
understanding
betwixt
man
and
beast.
"The
having
of
general
ideas,"
saith
he,
"is
that
which
puts
a
perfect
distinction
betwixt
man
and
brutes,
and
is
an
excellency
which
the
faculties
of
brutes
do
by
no
means
attain
unto.
For,
it
is
evident
we
observe
no
foot-steps
in
them
of
making
use
of
general
signs
for
universal
ideas;
from
which
we
have
reason
to
imagine
that
they
have
not
the
faculty
of
abstracting,
or
making
general
ideas,
since
they
have
no
use
of
words
or
any
other
general
signs."
And
a
little
after:
"Therefore,
I
think,
we
may
suppose
that
it
is
in
this
that
the
species
of
brutes
are
discriminated
from
men,
and
it
is
that
proper
difference
wherein
they
are
wholly
separated,
and
which
at
last
widens
to
so
wide
a
distance.
For,
if
they
have
any
ideas
at
all,
and
are
not
bare
machines
(as
some
would
have
them),
we
cannot
deny
them
to
have
some
reason.
It
seems
as
evident
to
me
that
they
do,
some
of
them,
in
certain
instances
reason
as
that
they
have
sense;
but
it
is
only
in
particular
ideas,
just
as
they
receive
them
from
their
senses.
They
are
the
best
of
them
tied
up
within
those
narrow
bounds,
and
have
not
(as
I
think)
the
faculty
to
enlarge
them
by
any
kind
of
abstraction."-

Understanding,

and

I
readily
agree
with
this
learned
author,
that
the
faculties
of
brutes
can
by
no
means
attain
to
abstraction.
But
then
if
this
be
made
the
distinguishing
property
of
that
sort
of
animals,
I
fear
a
great
many
of
those
that
pass
for
men
must
be
reckoned
into
their
number.
The
reason
that
is
here
assigned
why
we
have
no
grounds
to
think
brutes
have
abstract
general
ideas
is,
that
we
observe
in
them
no
use
of
words
or
any
other
general
signs;
which
is
built
on
this
supposition-
that
the
making
use
of
words
implies
the
having
general
ideas.
From
which
it
follows
that
men
who
use
language
are
able
to
abstract
or
generalize
their
ideas.
That
this
is
the
sense
and
arguing
of
the
author
will
further
appear
by
his
answering
the
question
he
in
another
place
puts:
"Since
all
things
that
exist
are
only
particulars,
how
come
we
by
general
terms?"
His
answer
is:
"Words
become
general
by
being
made
the
signs
of
general
ideas."-
Essay

Understanding,

But
it
seems
that
a
word
becomes
general
by
being
made
the
sign,
not
of
an
abstract
general
idea,
but
of
several
particular
ideas,
any
one
of
which
it
indifferently
suggests
to
the
mind.
For
example,
when
it
is
said
"the
change
of
motion
is
proportional
to
the
impressed
force,"
or
that
"whatever
has
extension
is
divisible,"
these
propositions
are
to
be
understood
of
motion
and
extension
in
general;
and
nevertheless
it
will
not
follow
that
they
suggest
to
my
thoughts
an
idea
of
motion
without
a
body
moved,
or
any
determinate
direction
and
velocity,
or
that
I
must
conceive
an
abstract
general
idea
of
extension,
which
is
neither
line,
surface,
nor
solid,
neither
great
nor
small,
black,
white,
nor
red,
nor
of
any
other
determinate
colour.
It
is
only
implied
that
whatever
particular
motion
I
consider,
whether
it
be
swift
or
slow,
perpendicular,
horizontal,
or
oblique,
or
in
whatever
object,
the
axiom
concerning
it
holds
equally
true.
As
does
the
other
of
every
particular
extension,
it
matters
not
whether
line,
surface,
or
solid,
whether
of
this
or
that
magnitude
or
figure.
12.
By
observing
how
ideas
become
general
we
may
the
better
judge
how
words
are
made
so.
And
here
it
is
to
be
noted
that
I
do
not
deny
absolutely
there
are
general
ideas,
but
only
that
there
are
any
abstract
general
ideas;
for,
in
the
passages
we
have
quoted
wherein
there
is
mention
of
general
ideas,
it
is
always
supposed
that
they
are
formed
by
abstraction,
after
the
manner
set
forth
in
sections
8
and
9.
Now,
if
we
will
annex
a
meaning
to
our
words,
and
speak
only
of
what
we
can
conceive,
I
believe
we
shall
acknowledge
that
an
idea
which,
considered
in
itself,
is
particular,
becomes
general
by
being
made
to
represent
or
stand
for
all
other
particular
ideas
of
the
same
sort.
To
make
this
plain
by
an
example,
suppose
a
geometrician
is
demonstrating
the
method
of
cutting
a
line
in
two
equal
parts.
He
draws,
for
instance,
a
black
line
of
an
inch
in
length:
this,
which
in
itself
is
a
particular
line,
is
nevertheless
with
regard
to
its
signification
general,
since,
as
it
is
there
used,
it
represents
all
particular
lines
whatsoever;
so
that
what
is
demonstrated
of
it
is
demonstrated
of
all
lines,
or,
in
other
words,
of
a
line
in
general.
And,
as
that
particular
line
becomes
general
by
being
made
a
sign,
so
the
name
"line,"
which
taken
absolutely
is
particular,
by
being
a
sign
is
made
general.
And
as
the
former
owes
its
generality
not
to
its
being
the
sign
of
an
abstract
or
general
line,
but
of
all
particular
right
lines
that
may
possibly
exist,
so
the
latter
must
be
thought
to
derive
its
generality
from
the
same
cause,
namely,
the
various
particular
lines
which
it
indifferently
denotes.
13.
To
give
the
reader
a
yet
clearer
view
of
the
nature
of
abstract
ideas,
and
the
uses
they
are
thought
necessary
to,
I
shall
add
one
more
passage
out
of
the
Essay
on
Human
Understanding,
(IV.
vii.
9)
which
is
as
follows:
"Abstract
ideas
are
not
so
obvious
or
easy
to
children
or
the
yet
unexercised
mind
as
particular
ones.
If
they
seem
so
to
grown
men
it
is
only
because
by
constant
and
familiar
use
they
are
made
so.
For,
when
we
nicely
reflect
upon
them,
we
shall
find
that
general
ideas
are
fictions
and
contrivances
of
the
mind,
that
carry
difficulty
with
them,
and
do
not
so
easily
offer
themselves
as
we
are
apt
to
imagine.
For
example,
does
it
not
require
some
pains
and
skill
to
form
the
general
idea
of
a
triangle
(which
is
yet
none
of
the
most
abstract,
comprehensive,
and
difficult);
for
it
must
be
neither
oblique
nor
rectangle,
neither
equilateral,
equicrural,
nor
scalenon,
but
all
and
none
of
these
at
once?
In
effect,
it
is
something
imperfect
that
cannot
exist,
an
idea
wherein
some
parts
of
several
different
and
inconsistent
ideas
are
put
together.
It
is
true
the
mind
in
this
imperfect
state
has
need
of
such
ideas,
and
makes
all
the
haste
to
them
it
can,
for
the
conveniency
of
communication
and
enlargement
of
knowledge,
to
both
which
it
is
naturally
very
much
inclined.
But
yet
one
has
reason
to
suspect
such
ideas
are
marks
of
our
imperfection.
At
least
this
is
enough
to
show
that
the
most
abstract
and
general
ideas
are
not
those
that
the
mind
is
first
and
most
easily
acquainted
with,
nor
such
as
its
earliest
knowledge
is
conversant
about."-
If
any
man
has
the
faculty
of
framing
in
his
mind
such
an
idea
of
a
triangle
as
is
here
described,
it
is
in
vain
to
pretend
to
dispute
him
out
of
it,
nor
would
I
go
about
it.
All
I
desire
is
that
the
reader
would
fully
and
certainly
inform
himself
whether
he
has
such
an
idea
or
no.
And
this,
methinks,
can
be
no
hard
task
for
anyone
to
perform.
What
more
easy
than
for
anyone
to
look
a
little
into
his
own
thoughts,
and
there
try
whether
he
has,
or
can
attain
to
have,
an
idea
that
shall
correspond
with
the
description
that
is
here
given
of
the
general
idea
of
a
triangle,
which
is
"neither
oblique
nor
rectangle,
equilateral,
equicrural
nor
scalenon,
but
all
and
none
of
these
at
once?"
14.
Much
is
here
said
of
the
difficulty
that
abstract
ideas
carry
with
them,
and
the
pains
and
skill
requisite
to
the
forming
them.
And
it
is
on
all
hands
agreed
that
there
is
need
of
great
toil
and
labour
of
the
mind,
to
emancipate
our
thoughts
from
particular
objects,
and
raise
them
to
those
sublime
speculations
that
are
conversant
about
abstract
ideas.
From
all
which
the
natural
consequence
should
seem
to
be,
that
so
difficult
a
thing
as
the
forming
abstract
ideas
was
not
necessary
for
communication,
which
is
so
easy
and
familiar
to
all
sorts
of
men.
But,
we
are
told,
if
they
seem
obvious
and
easy
to
grown
men,
it
is
only
because
by
constant
and
familiar
use
they
are
made
so.
Now,
I
would
fain
know
at
what
time
it
is
men
are
employed
in
surmounting
that
difficulty,
and
furnishing
themselves
with
those
necessary
helps
for
discourse.
It
cannot
be
when
they
are
grown
up,
for
then
it
seems
they
are
not
conscious
of
any
such
painstaking;
it
remains
therefore
to
be
the
business
of
their
childhood.
And
surely
the
great
and
multiplied
labour
of
framing
abstract
notions
will
be
found
a
hard
task
for
that
tender
age.
Is
it
not
a
hard
thing
to
imagine
that
a
couple
of
children
cannot
prate
together
of
their
sugar-plums
and
rattles
and
the
rest
of
their
little
trinkets,
till
they
have
first
tacked
together
numberless
inconsistencies,
and
so
framed
in
their
minds
abstract
general
ideas,
and
annexed
them
to
every
common
name
they
make
use
of?
15.
Nor
do
I
think
them
a
whit
more
needful
for
the
enlargement
of
knowledge
than
for
communication.
It
is,
I
know,
a
point
much
insisted
on,
that
all
knowledge
and
demonstration
are
about
universal
notions,
to
which
I
fully
agree:
but
then
it
doth
not
appear
to
me
that
those
notions
are
formed
by
abstraction
in
the
manner
premised-
universality,
so
far
as
I
can
comprehend,
not
consisting
in
the
absolute,
positive
nature
or
conception
of
anything,
but
in
the
relation
it
bears
to
the
particulars
signified
or
represented
by
it;
by
virtue
whereof
it
is
that
things,
names,
or
notions,
being
in
their
own
nature
particular,
are
rendered
universal.
Thus,
when
I
demonstrate
any
proposition
concerning
triangles,
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
I
have
in
view
the
universal
idea
of
a
triangle;
which
ought
not
to
be
understood
as
if
I
could
frame
an
idea
of
a
triangle
which
was
neither
equilateral,
nor
scalenon,
nor
equicrural;
but
only
that
the
particular
triangle
I
consider,
whether
of
this
or
that
sort
it
matters
not,
doth
equally
stand
for
and
represent
all
rectilinear
triangles
whatsoever,
and
is
in
that
sense
universal.
All
which
seems
very
plain
and
not
to
include
any
difficulty
in
it.
16.
But
here
it
will
be
demanded,
how
we
can
know
any
proposition
to
be
true
of
all
particular
triangles,
except
we
have
first
seen
it
demonstrated
of
the
abstract
idea
of
a
triangle
which
equally
agrees
to
all?
For,
because
a
property
may
be
demonstrated
to
agree
to
some
one
particular
triangle,
it
will
not
thence
follow
that
it
equally
belongs
to
any
other
triangle,
which
in
all
respects
is
not
the
same
with
it.
For
example,
having
demonstrated
that
the
three
angles
of
an
isosceles
rectangular
triangle
are
equal
to
two
right
ones,
I
cannot
therefore
conclude
this
affection
agrees
to
all
other
triangles
which
have
neither
a
right
angle
nor
two
equal
sides.
It
seems
therefore
that,
to
be
certain
this
proposition
is
universally
true,
we
must
either
make
a
particular
demonstration
for
every
particular
triangle,
which
is
impossible,
or
once
for
all
demonstrate
it
of
the
abstract
idea
of
a
triangle,
in
which
all
the
particulars
do
indifferently
partake
and
by
which
they
are
all
equally
represented.
To
which
I
answer,
that,
though
the
idea
I
have
in
view
whilst
I
make
the
demonstration
be,
for
instance,
that
of
an
isosceles
rectangular
triangle
whose
sides
are
of
a
determinate
length,
I
may
nevertheless
be
certain
it
extends
to
all
other
rectilinear
triangles,
of
what
sort
or
bigness
soever.
And
that
because
neither
the
right
angle,
nor
the
equality,
nor
determinate
length
of
the
sides
are
at
all
concerned
in
the
demonstration.
It
is
true
the
diagram
I
have
in
view
includes
all
these
particulars,
but
then
there
is
not
the
least
mention
made
of
them
in
the
proof
of
the
proposition.
It
is
not
said
the
three
angles
are
equal
to
two
right
ones,
because
one
of
them
is
a
right
angle,
or
because
the
sides
comprehending
it
are
of
the
same
length.
Which
sufficiently
shows
that
the
right
angle
might
have
been
oblique,
and
the
sides
unequal,
and
for
all
that
the
demonstration
have
held
good.
And
for
this
reason
it
is
that
I
conclude
that
to
be
true
of
any
obliquangular
or
scalenon
which
I
had
demonstrated
of
a
particular
right-angled
equicrural
triangle,
and
not
because
I
demonstrated
the
proposition
of
the
abstract
idea
of
a
triangle
And
here
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
a
man
may
consider
a
figure
merely
as
triangular,
without
attending
to
the
particular
qualities
of
the
angles,
or
relations
of
the
sides.
So
far
he
may
abstract;
but
this
will
never
prove
that
he
can
frame
an
abstract,
general,
inconsistent
idea
of
a
triangle.
In
like
manner
we
may
consider
Peter
so
far
forth
as
man,
or
so
far
forth
as
animal
without
framing
the
fore-mentioned
abstract
idea,
either
of
man
or
of
animal,
inasmuch
as
all
that
is
perceived
is
not
considered.
17.
It
were
an
endless
as
well
as
an
useless
thing
to
trace
the
Schoolmen,
those
great
masters
of
abstraction,
through
all
the
manifold
inextricable
labyrinths
of
error
and
dispute
which
their
doctrine
of
abstract
natures
and
notions
seems
to
have
led
them
into.
What
bickerings
and
controversies,
and
what
a
learned
dust
have
been
raised
about
those
matters,
and
what
mighty
advantage
has
been
from
thence
derived
to
mankind,
are
things
at
this
day
too
clearly
known
to
need
being
insisted
on.
And
it
had
been
well
if
the
ill
effects
of
that
doctrine
were
confined
to
those
only
who
make
the
most
avowed
profession
of
it.
When
men
consider
the
great
pains,
industry,
and
parts
that
have
for
so
many
ages
been
laid
out
on
the
cultivation
and
advancement
of
the
sciences,
and
that
notwithstanding
all
this
the
far
greater
part
of
them
remains
full
of
darkness
and
uncertainty,
and
disputes
that
are
like
never
to
have
an
end,
and
even
those
that
are
thought
to
be
supported
by
the
most
clear
and
cogent
demonstrations
contain
in
them
paradoxes
which
are
perfectly
irreconcilable
to
the
understandings
of
men,
and
that,
taking
all
together,
a
very
small
portion
of
them
does
supply
any
real
benefit
to
mankind,
otherwise
than
by
being
an
innocent
diversion
and
amusement-
I
say
the
consideration
of
all
this
is
apt
to
throw
them
into
a
despondency
and
perfect
contempt
of
all
study.
But
this
may
perhaps
cease
upon
a
view
of
the
false
principles
that
have
obtained
in
the
world,
amongst
all
which
there
is
none,
methinks,
hath
a
more
wide
and
extended
sway
over
the
thoughts
of
speculative
men
than
this
of
abstract
general
ideas.
18.
I
come
now
to
consider
the
source
of
this
prevailing
notion,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
language.
And
surely
nothing
of
less
extent
than
reason
itself
could
have
been
the
source
of
an
opinion
so
universally
received.
The
truth
of
this
appears
as
from
other
reasons
so
also
from
the
plain
confession
of
the
ablest
patrons
of
abstract
ideas,
who
acknowledge
that
they
are
made
in
order
to
naming;
from
which
it
is
a
clear
consequence
that
if
there
had
been
no
such
things
as
speech
or
universal
signs
there
never
had
been
any
thought
of
abstraction.
See
III.
vi.
39,
and
elsewhere
of
the
Essay
on
Human
Understanding.
Let
us
examine
the
manner
wherein
words
have
contributed
to
the
origin
of
that
mistake.-
First
then,
it
is
thought
that
every
name
has,
or
ought
to
have,
one
only
precise
and
settled
signification,
which
inclines
men
to
think
there
are
certain
abstract,
determinate
ideas
that
constitute
the
true
and
only
immediate
signification
of
each
general
name;
and
that
it
is
by
the
mediation
of
these
abstract
ideas
that
a
general
name
comes
to
signify
any
particular
thing.
Whereas,
in
truth,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
one
precise
and
definite
signification
annexed
to
any
general
name,
they
all
signifying
indifferently
a
great
number
of
particular
ideas.
All
which
doth
evidently
follow
from
what
has
been
already
said,
and
will
clearly
appear
to
anyone
by
a
little
reflexion.
To
this
it
will
be
objected
that
every
name
that
has
a
definition
is
thereby
restrained
to
one
certain
signification.
For
example,
a
triangle
is
defined
to
be
"a
plain
surface
comprehended
by
three
right
lines,"
by
which
that
name
is
limited
to
denote
one
certain
idea
and
no
other.
To
which
I
answer,
that
in
the
definition
it
is
not
said
whether
the
surface
be
great
or
small,
black
or
white,
nor
whether
the
sides
are
long
or
short,
equal
or
unequal,
nor
with
what
angles
they
are
inclined
to
each
other;
in
all
which
there
may
be
great
variety,
and
consequently
there
is
no
one
settled
idea
which
limits
the
signification
of
the
word
triangle.
It
is
one
thing
for
to
keep
a
name
constantly
to
the
same
definition,
and
another
to
make
it
stand
everywhere
for
the
same
idea;
the
one
is
necessary,
the
other
useless
and
impracticable.
19.
But,
to
give
a
farther
account
how
words
came
to
produce
the
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas,
it
must
be
observed
that
it
is
a
received
opinion
that
language
has
no
other
end
but
the
communicating
our
ideas,
and
that
every
significant
name
stands
for
an
idea.
This
being
so,
and
it
being
withal
certain
that
names
which
yet
are
not
thought
altogether
insignificant
do
not
always
mark
out
particular
conceivable
ideas,
it
is
straightway
concluded
that
they
stand
for
abstract
notions.
That
there
are
many
names
in
use
amongst
speculative
men
which
do
not
always
suggest
to
others
determinate,
particular
ideas,
or
in
truth
anything
at
all,
is
what
nobody
will
deny.
And
a
little
attention
will
discover
that
it
is
not
necessary
(even
in
the
strictest
reasonings)
significant
names
which
stand
for
ideas
should,
every
time
they
are
used,
excite
in
the
understanding
the
ideas
they
are
made
to
stand
for-
in
reading
and
discoursing,
names
being
for
the
most
part
used
as
letters
are
in
Algebra,
in
which,
though
a
particular
quantity
be
marked
by
each
letter,
yet
to
proceed
right
it
is
not
requisite
that
in
every
step
each
letter
suggest
to
your
thoughts
that
particular
quantity
it
was
appointed
to
stand
for.
20.
Besides,
the
communicating
of
ideas
marked
by
words
is
not
the
chief
and
only
end
of
language,
as
is
commonly
supposed.
There
are
other
ends,
as
the
raising
of
some
passion,
the
exciting
to
or
deterring
from
an
action,
the
putting
the
mind
in
some
particular
disposition-
to
which
the
former
is
in
many
cases
barely
subservient,
and
sometimes
entirely
omitted,
when
these
can
be
obtained
without
it,
as
I
think
does
not
unfrequently
happen
in
the
familiar
use
of
language.
I
entreat
the
reader
to
reflect
with
himself,
and
see
if
it
doth
not
often
happen,
either
in
hearing
or
reading
a
discourse,
that
the
passions
of
fear,
love,
hatred,
admiration,
disdain,
and
the
like,
arise
immediately
in
his
mind
upon
the
perception
of
certain
words,
without
any
ideas
coming
between.
At
first,
indeed,
the
words
might
have
occasioned
ideas
that
were
fitting
to
produce
those
emotions;
but,
if
I
mistake
not,
it
will
be
found
that,
when
language
is
once
grown
familiar,
the
hearing
of
the
sounds
or
sight
of
the
characters
is
oft
immediately
attended
with
those
passions
which
at
first
were
wont
to
be
produced
by
the
intervention
of
ideas
that
are
now
quite
omitted.
May
we
not,
for
example,
be
affected
with
the
promise
of
a
good
thing,
though
we
have
not
an
idea
of
what
it
is?
Or
is
not
the
being
threatened
with
danger
sufficient
to
excite
a
dread,
though
we
think
not
of
any
particular
evil
likely
to
befal
us,
nor
yet
frame
to
ourselves
an
idea
of
danger
in
abstract?
If
any
one
shall
join
ever
so
little
reflexion
of
his
own
to
what
has
been
said,
I
believe
that
it
will
evidently
appear
to
him
that
general
names
are
often
used
in
the
propriety
of
language
without
the
speaker's
designing
them
for
marks
of
ideas
in
his
own,
which
he
would
have
them
raise
in
the
mind
of
the
hearer.
Even
proper
names
themselves
do
not
seem
always
spoken
with
a
design
to
bring
into
our
view
the
ideas
of
those
individuals
that
are
supposed
to
be
marked
by
them.
For
example,
when
a
schoolman
tells
me
"Aristotle
hath
said
it,"
all
I
conceive
he
means
by
it
is
to
dispose
me
to
embrace
his
opinion
with
the
deference
and
submission
which
custom
has
annexed
to
that
name.
And
this
effect
is
often
so
instantly
produced
in
the
minds
of
those
who
are
accustomed
to
resign
their
judgment
to
authority
of
that
philosopher,
as
it
is
impossible
any
idea
either
of
his
person,
writings,
or
reputation
should
go
before.
Innumerable
examples
of
this
kind
may
be
given,
but
why
should
I
insist
on
those
things
which
every
one's
experience
will,
I
doubt
not,
plentifully
suggest
unto
him?
21.
We
have,
I
think,
shewn
the
impossibility
of
Abstract
Ideas.
We
have
considered
what
has
been
said
for
them
by
their
ablest
patrons;
and
endeavored
to
show
they
are
of
no
use
for
those
ends
to
which
they
are
thought
necessary.
And
lastly,
we
have
traced
them
to
the
source
from
whence
they
flow,
which
appears
evidently
to
be
language.-
It
cannot
be
denied
that
words
are
of
excellent
use,
in
that
by
their
means
all
that
stock
of
knowledge
which
has
been
purchased
by
the
joint
labours
of
inquisitive
men
in
all
ages
and
nations
may
be
drawn
into
the
view
and
made
the
possession
of
one
single
person.
But
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
owned
that
most
parts
of
knowledge
have
been
strangely
perplexed
and
darkened
by
the
abuse
of
words,
and
general
ways
of
speech
wherein
they
are
delivered.
Since
therefore
words
are
so
apt
to
impose
on
the
understanding,
whatever
ideas
I
consider,
I
shall
endeavour
to
take
them
bare
and
naked
into
my
view,
keeping
out
of
my
thoughts
so
far
as
I
am
able,
those
names
which
long
and
constant
use
hath
so
strictly
united
with
them;
from
which
I
may
expect
to
derive
the
following
advantages:
22.
First,
I
shall
be
sure
to
get
clear
of
all
controversies
purely
verbal-
the
springing
up
of
which
weeds
in
almost
all
the
sciences
has
been
a
main
hindrance
to
the
growth
of
true
and
sound
knowledge.
Secondly,
this
seems
to
be
a
sure
way
to
extricate
myself
out
of
that
fine
and
subtle
net
of
abstract
ideas
which
has
so
miserably
perplexed
and
entangled
the
minds
of
men;
and
that
with
this
peculiar
circumstance,
that
by
how
much
the
finer
and
more
curious
was
the
wit
of
any
man,
by
so
much
the
deeper
was
he
likely
to
be
ensnared
and
faster
held
therein.
Thirdly,
so
long
as
I
confine
my
thoughts
to
my
own
ideas
divested
of
words,
I
do
not
see
how
I
can
easily
be
mistaken.
The
objects
I
consider,
I
clearly
and
adequately
know.
I
cannot
be
deceived
in
thinking
I
have
an
idea
which
I
have
not.
It
is
not
possible
for
me
to
imagine
that
any
of
my
own
ideas
are
alike
or
unlike
that
are
not
truly
so.
To
discern
the
agreements
or
disagreements
there
are
between
my
ideas,
to
see
what
ideas
are
included
in
any
compound
idea
and
what
not,
there
is
nothing
more
requisite
than
an
attentive
perception
of
what
passes
in
my
own
understanding.
23.
But
the
attainment
of
all
these
advantages
doth
presuppose
an
entire
deliverance
from
the
deception
of
words,
which
I
dare
hardly
promise
myself;
so
difficult
a
thing
it
is
to
dissolve
an
union
so
early
begun,
and
confirmed
by
so
long
a
habit
as
that
betwixt
words
and
ideas.
Which
difficulty
seems
to
have
been
very
much
increased
by
the
doctrine
of
abstraction.
For,
so
long
as
men
thought
abstract
ideas
were
annexed
to
their
words,
it
doth
not
seem
strange
that
they
should
use
words
for
ideas-
it
being
found
an
impracticable
thing
to
lay
aside
the
word,
and
retain
the
abstract
idea
in
the
mind,
which
in
itself
was
perfectly
inconceivable.
This
seems
to
me
the
principal
cause
why
those
men
who
have
so
emphatically
recommended
to
others
the
laying
aside
all
use
of
words
in
their
meditations,
and
contemplating
their
bare
ideas,
have
yet
failed
to
perform
it
themselves.
Of
late
many
have
been
very
sensible
of
the
absurd
opinions
and
insignificant
disputes
which
grow
out
of
the
abuse
of
words.
And,
in
order
to
remedy
these
evils,
they
advise
well,
that
we
attend
to
the
ideas
signified,
and
draw
off
our
attention
from
the
words
which
signify
them.
But,
how
good
soever
this
advice
may
be
they
have
given
others,
it
is
plain
they
could
not
have
a
due
regard
to
it
themselves,
so
long
as
they
thought
the
only
immediate
use
of
words
was
to
signify
ideas,
and
that
the
immediate
signification
of
every
general
name
was
a
determinate
abstract
idea.
24.
But,
these
being
known
to
be
mistakes,
a
man
may
with
greater
ease
prevent
his
being
imposed
on
by
words.
He
that
knows
he
has
no
other
than
particular
ideas,
will
not
puzzle
himself
in
vain
to
find
out
and
conceive
the
abstract
idea
annexed
to
any
name.
And
he
that
knows
names
do
not
always
stand
for
ideas
will
spare
himself
the
labour
of
looking
for
ideas
where
there
are
none
to
be
had.
It
were,
therefore,
to
be
wished
that
everyone
would
use
his
utmost
endeavours
to
obtain
a
clear
view
of
the
ideas
he
would
consider,
separating
from
them
all
that
dress
and
incumbrance
of
words
which
so
much
contribute
to
blind
the
judgment
and
divide
the
attention.
In
vain
do
we
extend
our
view
into
the
heavens
and
pry
into
the
entrails
of
the
earth,
in
vain
do
we
consult
the
writings
of
learned
men
and
trace
the
dark
footsteps
of
antiquity-
we
need
only
draw
the
curtain
of
words,
to
hold
the
fairest
tree
of
knowledge,
whose
fruit
is
excellent,
and
within
the
reach
of
our
hand.
25.
Unless
we
take
care
to
clear
the
First
Principles
of
Knowledge
from
the
embarras
and
delusion
of
words,
we
may
make
infinite
reasonings
upon
them
to
no
purpose;
we
may
draw
consequences
from
consequences,
and
be
never
the
wiser.
The
farther
we
go,
we
shall
only
lose
ourselves
the
more
irrecoverably,
and
be
the
deeper
entangled
in
difficulties
and
mistakes.
Whoever
therefore
designs
to
read
the
following
sheets,
I
entreat
him
to
make
my
words
the
occasion
of
his
own
thinking,
and
endeavour
to
attain
the
same
train
of
thoughts
in
reading
that
I
had
in
writing
them.
By
this
means
it
will
be
easy
for
him
to
discover
the
truth
or
falsity
of
what
I
say.
He
will
be
out
of
all
danger
of
being
deceived
by
my
words,
and
I
do
not
see
how
he
can
be
led
into
an
error
by
considering
his
own
naked,
undisguised
ideas.
A
TREATISE
CONCERNING
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF
HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE
1.
It
is
evident
to
any
one
who
takes
a
survey
of
the
objects
of
human
knowledge,
that
they
are
either
ideas
actually
imprinted
on
the
senses;
or
else
such
as
are
perceived
by
attending
to
the
passions
and
operations
of
the
mind;
or
lastly,
ideas
formed
by
help
of
memory
and
imagination-
either
compounding,
dividing,
or
barely
representing
those
originally
perceived
in
the
aforesaid
ways.
By
sight
I
have
the
ideas
of
light
and
colours,
with
their
several
degrees
and
variations.
By
touch
I
perceive
hard
and
soft,
heat
and
cold,
motion
and
resistance,
and
of
all
these
more
and
less
either
as
to
quantity
or
degree.
Smelling
furnishes
me
with
odours;
the
palate
with
tastes;
and
hearing
conveys
sounds
to
the
mind
in
all
their
variety
of
tone
and
composition.
And
as
several
of
these
are
observed
to
accompany
each
other,
they
come
to
be
marked
by
one
name,
and
so
to
be
reputed
as
one
thing.
Thus,
for
example
a
certain
colour,
taste,
smell,
figure
and
consistence
having
been
observed
to
go
together,
are
accounted
one
distinct
thing,
signified
by
the
name
apple;
other
collections
of
ideas
constitute
a
stone,
a
tree,
a
book,
and
the
like
sensible
things-
which
as
they
are
pleasing
or
disagreeable
excite
the
passions
of
love,
hatred,
joy,
grief,
and
so
forth.
2.
But,
besides
all
that
endless
variety
of
ideas
or
objects
of
knowledge,
there
is
likewise
something
which
knows
or
perceives
them,
and
exercises
divers
operations,
as
willing,
imagining,
remembering,
about
them.
This
perceiving,
active
being
is
what
I
call
mind,
spirit,
soul,
or
myself.
By
which
words
I
do
not
denote
any
one
of
my
ideas,
but
a
thing
entirely
distinct
from
them,
wherein,
they
exist,
or,
which
is
the
same
thing,
whereby
they
are
perceived-
for
the
existence
of
an
idea
consists
in
being
perceived.
3.
That
neither
our
thoughts,
nor
passions,
nor
ideas
formed
by
the
imagination,
exist
without
the
mind,
is
what
everybody
will
allow.
And
it
seems
no
less
evident
that
the
various
sensations
or
ideas
imprinted
on
the
sense,
however
blended
or
combined
together
(that
is,
whatever
objects
they
compose),
cannot
exist
otherwise
than
in
a
mind
perceiving
them.-
I
think
an
intuitive
knowledge
may
be
obtained
of
this
by
any
one
that
shall
attend
to
what
is
meant
by
the
term
exists,
when
applied
to
sensible
things.
The
table
I
write
on
I
say
exists,
that
is,
I
see
and
feel
it;
and
if
I
were
out
of
my
study
I
should
say
it
existed-
meaning
thereby
that
if
I
was
in
my
study
I
might
perceive
it,
or
that
some
other
spirit
actually
does
perceive
it.
There
was
an
odour,
that
is,
it
was
smelt;
there
was
a
sound,
that
is,
it
was
heard;
a
colour
or
figure,
and
it
was
perceived
by
sight
or
touch.
This
is
all
that
I
can
understand
by
these
and
the
like
expressions.
For
as
to
what
is
said
of
the
absolute
existence
of
unthinking
things
without
any
relation
to
their
being
perceived,
that
seems
perfectly
unintelligible.
Their
esse
is
percepi,
nor
is
it
possible
they
should
have
any
existence
out
of
the
minds
or
thinking
things
which
perceive
them.
4.
It
is
indeed
an
opinion
strangely
prevailing
amongst
men,
that
houses,
mountains,
rivers,
and
in
a
word
all
sensible
objects,
have
an
existence,
natural
or
real,
distinct
from
their
being
perceived
by
the
understanding.
But,
with
how
great
an
assurance
and
acquiescence
soever
this
principle
may
be
entertained
in
the
world,
yet
whoever
shall
find
in
his
heart
to
call
it
in
question
may,
if
I
mistake
not,
perceive
it
to
involve
a
manifest
contradiction.
For,
what
are
the
fore-mentioned
objects
but
the
things
we
perceive
by
sense?
and
what
do
we
perceive
besides
our
own
ideas
or
sensations?
and
is
it
not
plainly
repugnant
that
any
one
of
these,
or
any
combination
of
them,
should
exist
unperceived?
5.
If
we
thoroughly
examine
this
tenet
it
will,
perhaps,
be
found
at
bottom
to
depend
on
the
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas.
For
can
there
be
a
nicer
strain
of
abstraction
than
to
distinguish
the
existence
of
sensible
objects
from
their
being
perceived,
so
as
to
conceive
them
existing
unperceived?
Light
and
colours,
heat
and
cold,
extension
and
figures-
in
a
word
the
things
we
see
and
feel-
what
are
they
but
so
many
sensations,
notions,
ideas,
or
impressions
on
the
sense?
and
is
it
possible
to
separate,
even
in
thought,
any
of
these
from
perception?
For
my
part,
I
might
as
easily
divide
a
thing
from
itself.
I
may,
indeed,
divide
in
my
thoughts,
or
conceive
apart
from
each
other,
those
things
which,
perhaps
I
never
perceived
by
sense
so
divided.
Thus,
I
imagine
the
trunk
of
a
human
body
without
the
limbs,
or
conceive
the
smell
of
a
rose
without
thinking
on
the
rose
itself.
So
far,
I
will
not
deny,
I
can
abstract-
if
that
may
properly
be
called
abstraction
which
extends
only
to
the
conceiving
separately
such
objects
as
it
is
possible
may
really
exist
or
be
actually
perceived
asunder.
But
my
conceiving
or
imagining
power
does
not
extend
beyond
the
possibility
of
real
existence
or
perception.
Hence,
as
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
see
or
feel
anything
without
an
actual
sensation
of
that
thing,
so
is
it
impossible
for
me
to
conceive
in
my
thoughts
any
sensible
thing
or
object
distinct
from
the
sensation
or
perception
of
it.
6.
Some
truths
there
are
so
near
and
obvious
to
the
mind
that
a
man
need
only
open
his
eyes
to
see
them.
Such
I
take
this
important
one
to
be,
viz.,
that
all
the
choir
of
heaven
and
furniture
of
the
earth,
in
a
word
all
those
bodies
which
compose
the
mighty
frame
of
the
world,
have
not
any
subsistence
without
a
mind,
that
their
being
is
to
be
perceived
or
known;
that
consequently
so
long
as
they
are
not
actually
perceived
by
me,
or
do
not
exist
in
my
mind
or
that
of
any
other
created
spirit,
they
must
either
have
no
existence
at
all,
or
else
subsist
in
the
mind
of
some
Eternal
Spirit-
it
being
perfectly
unintelligible,
and
involving
all
the
absurdity
of
abstraction,
to
attribute
to
any
single
part
of
them
an
existence
independent
of
a
spirit.
To
be
convinced
of
which,
the
reader
need
only
reflect,
and
try
to
separate
in
his
own
thoughts
the
being
of
a
sensible
thing
from
its
being
perceived.
7.
From
what
has
been
said
it
follows
there
is
not
any
other
Substance
than
Spirit,
or
that
which
perceives.
But,
for
the
fuller
proof
of
this
point,
let
it
be
considered
the
sensible
qualities
are
colour,
figure,
motion,
smell,
taste,
etc.,
i.e.
the
ideas
perceived
by
sense.
Now,
for
an
idea
to
exist
in
an
unperceiving
thing
is
a
manifest
contradiction,
for
to
have
an
idea
is
all
one
as
to
perceive;
that
therefore
wherein
colour,
figure,
and
the
like
qualities
exist
must
perceive
them;
hence
it
is
clear
there
can
be
no
unthinking
substance
or
substratum
of
those
ideas.
8.
But,
say
you,
though
the
ideas
themselves
do
not
exist
without
the
mind,
yet
there
may
be
things
like
them,
whereof
they
are
copies
or
resemblances,
which
things
exist
without
the
mind
in
an
unthinking
substance.
I
answer,
an
idea
can
be
like
nothing
but
an
idea;
a
colour
or
figure
can
be
like
nothing
but
another
colour
or
figure.
If
we
look
but
never
so
little
into
our
thoughts,
we
shall
find
it
impossible
for
us
to
conceive
a
likeness
except
only
between
our
ideas.
Again,
I
ask
whether
those
supposed
originals
or
external
things,
of
which
our
ideas
are
the
pictures
or
representations,
be
themselves
perceivable
or
no?
If
they
are,
then
they
are
ideas
and
we
have
gained
our
point;
but
if
you
say
they
are
not,
I
appeal
to
any
one
whether
it
be
sense
to
assert
a
colour
is
like
something
which
is
invisible;
hard
or
soft,
like
something
which
is
intangible;
and
so
of
the
rest.
9.
Some
there
are
who
make
a
distinction
betwixt
primary
and
secondary
qualities.
By
the
former
they
mean
extension,
figure,
motion,
rest,
solidity
or
impenetrability,
and
number;
by
the
latter
they
denote
all
other
sensible
qualities,
as
colours,
sounds,
tastes,
and
so
forth.
The
ideas
we
have
of
these
they
acknowledge
not
to
be
the
resemblances
of
anything
existing
without
the
mind,
or
unperceived,
but
they
will
have
our
ideas
of
the
primary
qualities
to
be
patterns
or
images
of
things
which
exist
without
the
mind,
in
an
unthinking
substance
which
they
call
Matter.
By
Matter,
therefore,
we
are
to
understand
an
inert,
senseless
substance,
in
which
extension,
figure,
and
motion
do
actually
subsist.
But
it
is
evident
from
what
we
have
already
shown,
that
extension,
figure,
and
motion
are
only
ideas
existing
in
the
mind,
and
that
an
idea
can
be
like
nothing
but
another
idea,
and
that
consequently
neither
they
nor
their
archetypes
can
exist
in
an
unperceiving
substance.
Hence,
it
is
plain
that
that
the
very
notion
of
what
is
called
Matter
or
corporeal
substance,
involves
a
contradiction
in
it.
10.
They
who
assert
that
figure,
motion,
and
the
rest
of
the
primary
or
original
qualities
do
exist
without
the
mind
in
unthinking
substances,
do
at
the
same
time
acknowledge
that
colours,
sounds,
heat
cold,
and
suchlike
secondary
qualities,
do
not-
which
they
tell
us
are
sensations
existing
in
the
mind
alone,
that
depend
on
and
are
occasioned
by
the
different
size,
texture,
and
motion
of
the
minute
particles
of
matter.
This
they
take
for
an
undoubted
truth,
which
they
can
demonstrate
beyond
all
exception.
Now,
if
it
be
certain
that
those
original
qualities
are
inseparably
united
with
the
other
sensible
qualities,
and
not,
even
in
thought,
capable
of
being
abstracted
from
them,
it
plainly
follows
that
they
exist
only
in
the
mind.
But
I
desire
any
one
to
reflect
and
try
whether
he
can,
by
any
abstraction
of
thought,
conceive
the
extension
and
motion
of
a
body
without
all
other
sensible
qualities.
For
my
own
part,
I
see
evidently
that
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
frame
an
idea
of
a
body
extended
and
moving,
but
I
must
withal
give
it
some
colour
or
other
sensible
quality
which
is
acknowledged
to
exist
only
in
the
mind.
In
short,
extension,
figure,
and
motion,
abstracted
from
all
other
qualities,
are
inconceivable.
Where
therefore
the
other
sensible
qualities
are,
there
must
these
be
also,
to
wit,
in
the
mind
and
nowhere
else.
11.
Again,
great
and
small,
swift
and
slow,
are
allowed
to
exist
nowhere
without
the
mind,
being
entirely
relative,
and
changing
as
the
frame
or
position
of
the
organs
of
sense
varies.
The
extension
therefore
which
exists
without
the
mind
is
neither
great
nor
small,
the
motion
neither
swift
nor
slow,
that
is,
they
are
nothing
at
all.
But,
say
you,
they
are
extension
in
general,
and
motion
in
general:
thus
we
see
how
much
the
tenet
of
extended
movable
substances
existing
without
the
mind
depends
on
the
strange
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas.
And
here
I
cannot
but
remark
how
nearly
the
vague
and
indeterminate
description
of
Matter
or
corporeal
substance,
which
the
modern
philosophers
are
run
into
by
their
own
principles,
resembles
that
antiquated
and
so
much
ridiculed
notion
of
materia
prima,
to
be
met
with
in
Aristotle
and
his
followers.
Without
extension
solidity
cannot
be
conceived;
since
therefore
it
has
been
shewn
that
extension
exists
not
in
an
unthinking
substance,
the
same
must
also
be
true
of
solidity.
12.
That
number
is
entirely
the
creature
of
the
mind,
even
though
the
other
qualities
be
allowed
to
exist
without,
will
be
evident
to
whoever
considers
that
the
same
thing
bears
a
different
denomination
of
number
as
the
mind
views
it
with
different
respects.
Thus,
the
same
extension
is
one,
or
three,
or
thirty-six,
according
as
the
mind
considers
it
with
reference
to
a
yard,
a
foot,
or
an
inch.
Number
is
so
visibly
relative,
and
dependent
on
men's
understanding,
that
it
is
strange
to
think
how
any
one
should
give
it
an
absolute
existence
without
the
mind.
We
say
one
book,
one
page,
one
line,
etc.;
all
these
are
equally
units,
though
some
contain
several
of
the
others.
And
in
each
instance,
it
is
plain,
the
unit
relates
to
some
particular
combination
of
ideas
arbitrarily
put
together
by
the
mind.
13.
Unity
I
know
some
will
have
to
be
a
simple
or
uncompounded
idea,
accompanying
all
other
ideas
into
the
mind.
That
I
have
any
such
idea
answering
the
word
unity
I
do
not
find;
and
if
I
had,
methinks
I
could
not
miss
finding
it:
on
the
contrary,
it
should
be
the
most
familiar
to
my
understanding,
since
it
is
said
to
accompany
all
other
ideas,
and
to
be
perceived
by
all
the
ways
of
sensation
and
reflexion.
To
say
no
more,
it
is
an
abstract
idea.
14.
I
shall
farther
add,
that,
after
the
same
manner
as
modern
philosophers
prove
certain
sensible
qualities
to
have
no
existence
in
Matter,
or
without
the
mind,
the
same
thing
may
be
likewise
proved
of
all
other
sensible
qualities
whatsoever.
Thus,
for
instance,
it
is
said
that
heat
and
cold
are
affections
only
of
the
mind,
and
not
at
all
patterns
of
real
beings,
existing
in
the
corporeal
substances
which
excite
them,
for
that
the
same
body
which
appears
cold
to
one
hand
seems
warm
to
another.
Now,
why
may
we
not
as
well
argue
that
figure
and
extension
are
not
patterns
or
resemblances
of
qualities
existing
in
Matter,
because
to
the
same
eye
at
different
stations,
or
eyes
of
a
different
texture
at
the
same
station,
they
appear
various,
and
cannot
therefore
be
the
images
of
anything
settled
and
determinate
without
the
mind?
Again,
it
is
proved
that
sweetness
is
not
really
in
the
sapid
thing,
because
the
thing
remaining
unaltered
the
sweetness
is
changed
into
bitter,
as
in
case
of
a
fever
or
otherwise
vitiated
palate.
Is
it
not
as
reasonable
to
say
that
motion
is
not
without
the
mind,
since
if
the
succession
of
ideas
in
the
mind
become
swifter,
the
motion,
it
is
acknowledged,
shall
appear
slower
without
any
alteration
in
any
external
object?
15.
In
short,
let
any
one
consider
those
arguments
which
are
thought
manifestly
to
prove
that
colours
and
taste
exist
only
in
the
mind,
and
he
shall
find
they
may
with
equal
force
be
brought
to
prove
the
same
thing
of
extension,
figure,
and
motion.
Though
it
must
be
confessed
this
method
of
arguing
does
not
so
much
prove
that
there
is
no
extension
or
colour
in
an
outward
object,
as
that
we
do
not
know
by
sense
which
is
the
true
extension
or
colour
of
the
object.
But
the
arguments
foregoing
plainly
shew
it
to
be
impossible
that
any
colour
or
extension
at
all,
or
other
sensible
quality
whatsoever,
should
exist
in
an
unthinking
subject
without
the
mind,
or
in
truth,
that
there
should
be
any
such
thing
as
an
outward
object.
16.
But
let
us
examine
a
little
the
received
opinion.-
It
is
said
extension
is
a
mode
or
accident
of
Matter,
and
that
Matter
is
the
substratum
that
supports
it.
Now
I
desire
that
you
would
explain
to
me
what
is
meant
by
Matter's
supporting
extension.
Say
you,
I
have
no
idea
of
Matter
and
therefore
cannot
explain
it.
I
answer,
though
you
have
no
positive,
yet,
if
you
have
any
meaning
at
all,
you
must
at
least
have
a
relative
idea
of
Matter;
though
you
know
not
what
it
is,
yet
you
must
be
supposed
to
know
what
relation
it
bears
to
accidents,
and
what
is
meant
by
its
supporting
them.
It
is
evident
"support"
cannot
here
be
taken
in
its
usual
or
literal
sense-
as
when
we
say
that
pillars
support
a
building;
in
what
sense
therefore
must
it
be
taken?
17.
If
we
inquire
into
what
the
most
accurate
philosophers
declare
themselves
to
mean
by
material
substance,
we
shall
find
them
acknowledge
they
have
no
other
meaning
annexed
to
those
sounds
but
the
idea
of
Being
in
general,
together
with
the
relative
notion
of
its
supporting
accidents.
The
general
idea
of
Being
appeareth
to
me
the
most
abstract
and
incomprehensible
of
all
other;
and
as
for
its
supporting
accidents,
this,
as
we
have
just
now
observed,
cannot
be
understood
in
the
common
sense
of
those
words;
it
must
therefore
be
taken
in
some
other
sense,
but
what
that
is
they
do
not
explain.
So
that
when
I
consider
the
two
parts
or
branches
which
make
the
signification
of
the
words
material
substance,
I
am
convinced
there
is
no
distinct
meaning
annexed
to
them.
But
why
should
we
trouble
ourselves
any
farther,
in
discussing
this
material
substratum
or
support
of
figure
and
motion,
and
other
sensible
qualities?
Does
it
not
suppose
they
have
an
existence
without
the
mind?
And
is
not
this
a
direct
repugnancy,
and
altogether
inconceivable?
18.
But,
though
it
were
possible
that
solid,
figured,
movable
substances
may
exist
without
the
mind,
corresponding
to
the
ideas
we
have
of
bodies,
yet
how
is
it
possible
for
us
to
know
this?
Either
we
must
know
it
by
sense
or
by
reason.
As
for
our
senses,
by
them
we
have
the
knowledge
only
of
our
sensations,
ideas,
or
those
things
that
are
immediately
perceived
by
sense,
call
them
what
you
will:
but
they
do
not
inform
us
that
things
exist
without
the
mind,
or
unperceived,
like
to
those
which
are
perceived.
This
the
materialists
themselves
acknowledge.
It
remains
therefore
that
if
we
have
any
knowledge
at
all
of
external
things,
it
must
be
by
reason,
inferring
their
existence
from
what
is
immediately
perceived
by
sense.
But
what
reason
can
induce
us
to
believe
the
existence
of
bodies
without
the
mind,
from
what
we
perceive,
since
the
very
patrons
of
Matter
themselves
do
not
pretend
there
is
any
necessary
connexion
betwixt
them
and
our
ideas?
I
say
it
is
granted
on
all
hands
(and
what
happens
in
dreams,
phrensies,
and
the
like,
puts
it
beyond
dispute)
that
it
is
possible
we
might
be
affected
with
all
the
ideas
we
have
now,
though
there
were
no
bodies
existing
without
resembling
them.
Hence,
it
is
evident
the
supposition
of
external
bodies
is
not
necessary
for
the
producing
our
ideas;
since
it
is
granted
they
are
produced
sometimes,
and
might
possibly
be
produced
always
in
the
same
order,
we
see
them
in
at
present,
without
their
concurrence.
19.
But,
though
we
might
possibly
have
all
our
sensations
without
them,
yet
perhaps
it
may
be
thought
easier
to
conceive
and
explain
the
manner
of
their
production,
by
supposing
external
bodies
in
their
likeness
rather
than
otherwise;
and
so
it
might
be
at
least
probable
there
are
such
things
as
bodies
that
excite
their
ideas
in
our
minds.
But
neither
can
this
be
said;
for,
though
we
give
the
materialists
their
external
bodies,
they
by
their
own
confession
are
never
the
nearer
knowing
how
our
ideas
are
produced;
since
they
own
themselves
unable
to
comprehend
in
what
manner
body
can
act
upon
spirit,
or
how
it
is
possible
it
should
imprint
any
idea
in
the
mind.
Hence
it
is
evident
the
production
of
ideas
or
sensations
in
our
minds
can
be
no
reason
why
we
should
suppose
Matter
or
corporeal
substances,
since
that
is
acknowledged
to
remain
equally
inexplicable
with
or
without
this
supposition.
If
therefore
it
were
possible
for
bodies
to
exist
without
the
mind,
yet
to
hold
they
do
so,
must
needs
be
a
very
precarious
opinion;
since
it
is
to
suppose,
without
any
reason
at
all,
that
God
has
created
innumerable
beings
that
are
entirely
useless,
and
serve
to
no
manner
of
purpose.
20.
In
short,
if
there
were
external
bodies,
it
is
impossible
we
should
ever
come
to
know
it;
and
if
there
were
not,
we
might
have
the
very
same
reasons
to
think
there
were
that
we
have
now.
Suppose-
what
no
one
can
deny
possible-
an
intelligence
without
the
help
of
external
bodies,
to
be
affected
with
the
same
train
of
sensations
or
ideas
that
you
are,
imprinted
in
the
same
order
and
with
like
vividness
in
his
mind.
I
ask
whether
that
intelligence
hath
not
all
the
reason
to
believe
the
existence
of
corporeal
substances,
represented
by
his
ideas,
and
exciting
them
in
his
mind,
that
you
can
possibly
have
for
believing
the
same
thing?
Of
this
there
can
be
no
question-
which
one
consideration
were
enough
to
make
any
reasonable
person
suspect
the
strength
of
whatever
arguments
be
may
think
himself
to
have,
for
the
existence
of
bodies
without
the
mind.
21.
Were
it
necessary
to
add
any
farther
proof
against
the
existence
of
Matter
after
what
has
been
said,
I
could
instance
several
of
those
errors
and
difficulties
(not
to
mention
impieties)
which
have
sprung
from
that
tenet.
It
has
occasioned
numberless
controversies
and
disputes
in
philosophy,
and
not
a
few
of
far
greater
moment
in
religion.
But
I
shall
not
enter
into
the
detail
of
them
in
this
place,
as
well
because
I
think
arguments
a
posteriori
are
unnecessary
for
confirming
what
has
been,
if
I
mistake
not,
sufficiently
demonstrated
a
priori,
as
because
I
shall
hereafter
find
occasion
to
speak
somewhat
of
them.
22.
I
am
afraid
I
have
given
cause
to
think
I
am
needlessly
prolix
in
handling
this
subject.
For,
to
what
purpose
is
it
to
dilate
on
that
which
may
be
demonstrated
with
the
utmost
evidence
in
a
line
or
two,
to
any
one
that
is
capable
of
the
least
reflexion?
It
is
but
looking
into
your
own
thoughts,
and
so
trying
whether
you
can
conceive
it
possible
for
a
sound,
or
figure,
or
motion,
or
colour
to
exist
without
the
mind
or
unperceived.
This
easy
trial
may
perhaps
make
you
see
that
what
you
contend
for
is
a
downright
contradiction.
Insomuch
that
I
am
content
to
put
the
whole
upon
this
issue:-
If
you
can
but
conceive
it
possible
for
one
extended
movable
substance,
or,
in
general,
for
any
one
idea,
or
anything
like
an
idea,
to
exist
otherwise
than
in
a
mind
perceiving
it,
I
shall
readily
give
up
the
cause.
And,
as
for
all
that
compages
of
external
bodies
you
contend
for,
I
shall
grant
you
its
existence,
though
you
cannot
either
give
me
any
reason
why
you
believe
it
exists,
or
assign
any
use
to
it
when
it
is
supposed
to
exist.
I
say,
the
bare
possibility
of
your
opinions
being
true
shall
pass
for
an
argument
that
it
is
so.
23.
But,
say
you,
surely
there
is
nothing
easier
than
for
me
to
imagine
trees,
for
instance,
in
a
park,
or
books
existing
in
a
closet,
and
nobody
by
to
perceive
them.
I
answer,
you
may
so,
there
is
no
difficulty
in
it;
but
what
is
all
this,
I
beseech
you,
more
than
framing
in
your
mind
certain
ideas
which
you
call
books
and
trees,
and
the
same
time
omitting
to
frame
the
idea
of
any
one
that
may
perceive
them?
But
do
not
you
yourself
perceive
or
think
of
them
all
the
while?
This
therefore
is
nothing
to
the
purpose;
it
only
shews
you
have
the
power
of
imagining
or
forming
ideas
in
your
mind:
but
it
does
not
shew
that
you
can
conceive
it
possible
the
objects
of
your
thought
may
exist
without
the
mind.
To
make
out
this,
it
is
necessary
that
you
conceive
them
existing
unconceived
or
unthought
of,
which
is
a
manifest
repugnancy.
When
we
do
our
utmost
to
conceive
the
existence
of
external
bodies,
we
are
all
the
while
only
contemplating
our
own
ideas.
But
the
mind
taking
no
notice
of
itself,
is
deluded
to
think
it
can
and
does
conceive
bodies
existing
unthought
of
or
without
the
mind,
though
at
the
same
time
they
are
apprehended
by
or
exist
in
itself.
A
little
attention
will
discover
to
any
one
the
truth
and
evidence
of
what
is
here
said,
and
make
it
unnecessary
to
insist
on
any
other
proofs
against
the
existence
of
material
substance.
24.
It
is
very
obvious,
upon
the
least
inquiry
into
our
thoughts,
to
know
whether
it
is
possible
for
us
to
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
absolute
existence
of
sensible
objects
in
themselves,
or
without
the
mind.
To
me
it
is
evident
those
words
mark
out
either
a
direct
contradiction,
or
else
nothing
at
all.
And
to
convince
others
of
this,
I
know
no
readier
or
fairer
way
than
to
entreat
they
would
calmly
attend
to
their
own
thoughts;
and
if
by
this
attention
the
emptiness
or
repugnancy
of
those
expressions
does
appear,
surely
nothing
more
is
requisite
for
the
conviction.
It
is
on
this
therefore
that
I
insist,
to
wit,
that
the
absolute
existence
of
unthinking
things
are
words
without
a
meaning,
or
which
include
a
contradiction.
This
is
what
I
repeat
and
inculcate,
and
earnestly
recommend
to
the
attentive
thoughts
of
the
reader.
25.
All
our
ideas,
sensations,
notions,
or
the
things
which
we
perceive,
by
whatsoever
names
they
may
be
distinguished,
are
visibly
inactive-
there
is
nothing
of
power
or
agency
included
in
them.
So
that
one
idea
or
object
of
thought
cannot
produce
or
make
any
alteration
in
another.
To
be
satisfied
of
the
truth
of
this,
there
is
nothing
else
requisite
but
a
bare
observation
of
our
ideas.
For,
since
they
and
every
part
of
them
exist
only
in
the
mind,
it
follows
that
there
is
nothing
in
them
but
what
is
perceived:
but
whoever
shall
attend
to
his
ideas,
whether
of
sense
or
reflexion,
will
not
perceive
in
them
any
power
or
activity;
there
is,
therefore,
no
such
thing
contained
in
them.
A
little
attention
will
discover
to
us
that
the
very
being
of
an
idea
implies
passiveness
and
inertness
in
it,
insomuch
that
it
is
impossible
for
an
idea
to
do
anything,
or,
strictly
speaking,
to
be
the
cause
of
anything:
neither
can
it
be
the
resemblance
or
pattern
of
any
active
being,
as
is
evident
from
sect.
8.
Whence
it
plainly
follows
that
extension,
figure,
and
motion
cannot
be
the
cause
of
our
sensations.
To
say,
therefore,
that
these
are
the
effects
of
powers
resulting
from
the
configuration,
number,
motion,
and
size
of
corpuscles,
must
certainly
be
false.
26.
We
perceive
a
continual
succession
of
ideas,
some
are
anew
excited,
others
are
changed
or
totally
disappear.
There
is
therefore
some
cause
of
these
ideas,
whereon
they
depend,
and
which
produces
and
changes
them.
That
this
cause
cannot
be
any
quality
or
idea
or
combination
of
ideas,
is
clear
from
the
preceding
section.
I
must
therefore
be
a
substance;
but
it
has
been
shewn
that
there
is
no
corporeal
or
material
substance:
it
remains
therefore
that
the
cause
of
ideas
is
an
incorporeal
active
substance
or
Spirit.
27.
A
spirit
is
one
simple,
undivided,
active
being-
as
it
perceives
ideas
it
is
called
the
understanding,
and
as
it
produces
or
otherwise
operates
about
them
it
is
called
the
will.
Hence
there
can
be
no
idea
formed
of
a
soul
or
spirit;
for
all
ideas
whatever,
being
passive
and
inert
(vide
sect.
25),
they
cannot
represent
unto
us,
by
way
of
image
or
likeness,
that
which
acts.
A
little
attention
will
make
it
plain
to
any
one,
that
to
have
an
idea
which
shall
be
like
that
active
principle
of
motion
and
change
of
ideas
is
absolutely
impossible.
Such
is
the
nature
of
spirit,
or
that
which
acts,
that
it
cannot
be
of
itself
perceived,
but
only
by
the
effects
which
it
produceth.
If
any
man
shall
doubt
of
the
truth
of
what
is
here
delivered,
let
him
but
reflect
and
try
if
he
can
frame
the
idea
of
any
power
or
active
being,
and
whether
he
has
ideas
of
two
principal
powers,
marked
by
the
names
will
and
understanding,
distinct
from
each
other
as
well
as
from
a
third
idea
of
Substance
or
Being
in
general,
with
a
relative
notion
of
its
supporting
or
being
the
subject
of
the
aforesaid
powers-
which
is
signified
by
the
name
soul
or
spirit.
This
is
what
some
hold;
but,
so
far
as
I
can
see,
the
words
will,
soul,
spirit,
do
not
stand
for
different
ideas,
or,
in
truth,
for
any
idea
at
all,
but
for
something
which
is
very
different
from
ideas,
and
which,
being
an
agent,
cannot
be
like
unto,
or
represented
by,
any
idea
whatsoever.
Though
it
must
be
owned
at
the
same
time
that
we
have
some
notion
of
soul,
spirit,
and
the
operations
of
the
mind:
such
as
willing,
loving,
hating-
inasmuch
as
we
know
or
understand
the
meaning
of
these
words.
28.
I
find
I
can
excite
ideas
in
my
mind
at
pleasure,
and
vary
and
shift
the
scene
as
oft
as
I
think
fit.
It
is
no
more
than
willing,
and
straightway
this
or
that
idea
arises
in
my
fancy;
and
by
the
same
power
it
is
obliterated
and
makes
way
for
another.
This
making
and
unmaking
of
ideas
doth
very
properly
denominate
the
mind
active.
Thus
much
is
certain
and
grounded
on
experience;
but
when
we
think
of
unthinking
agents
or
of
exciting
ideas
exclusive
of
volition,
we
only
amuse
ourselves
with
words.
29.
But,
whatever
power
I
may
have
over
my
own
thoughts,
I
find
the
ideas
actually
perceived
by
Sense
have
not
a
like
dependence
on
my
will.
When
in
broad
daylight
I
open
my
eyes,
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
choose
whether
I
shall
see
or
no,
or
to
determine
what
particular
objects
shall
present
themselves
to
my
view;
and
so
likewise
as
to
the
hearing
and
other
senses;
the
ideas
imprinted
on
them
are
not
creatures
of
my
will.
There
is
therefore
some
other
Will
or
Spirit
that
produces
them.
30.
The
ideas
of
Sense
are
more
strong,
lively,
and
distinct
than
those
of
the
imagination;
they
have
likewise
a
steadiness,
order,
and
coherence,
and
are
not
excited
at
random,
as
those
which
are
the
effects
of
human
wills
often
are,
but
in
a
regular
train
or
series,
the
admirable
connexion
whereof
sufficiently
testifies
the
wisdom
and
benevolence
of
its
Author.
Now
the
set
rules
or
established
methods
wherein
the
Mind
we
depend
on
excites
in
us
the
ideas
of
sense,
are
called
the
laws
of
nature;
and
these
we
learn
by
experience,
which
teaches
us
that
such
and
such
ideas
are
attended
with
such
and
such
other
ideas,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things.
31.
This
gives
us
a
sort
of
foresight
which
enables
us
to
regulate
our
actions
for
the
benefit
of
life.
And
without
this
we
should
be
eternally
at
a
loss;
we
could
not
know
how
to
act
anything
that
might
procure
us
the
least
pleasure,
or
remove
the
least
pain
of
sense.
That
food
nourishes,
sleep
refreshes,
and
fire
warms
us;
that
to
sow
in
the
seed-time
is
the
way
to
reap
in
the
harvest;
and
in
general
that
to
obtain
such
or
such
ends,
such
or
such
means
are
conducive-
all
this
we
know,
not
by
discovering
any
necessary
connexion
between
our
ideas,
but
only
by
the
observation
of
the
settled
laws
of
nature,
without
which
we
should
be
all
in
uncertainty
and
confusion,
and
a
grown
man
no
more
know
how
to
manage
himself
in
the
affairs
of
life
than
an
infant
just
born.
32.
And
yet
this
consistent
uniform
working,
which
so
evidently
displays
the
goodness
and
wisdom
of
that
Governing
Spirit
whose
Will
constitutes
the
laws
of
nature,
is
so
far
from
leading
our
thoughts
to
Him,
that
it
rather
sends
them
wandering
after
second
causes.
For,
when
we
perceive
certain
ideas
of
Sense
constantly
followed
by
other
ideas
and
we
know
this
is
not
of
our
own
doing,
we
forthwith
attribute
power
and
agency
to
the
ideas
themselves,
and
make
one
the
cause
of
another,
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
and
unintelligible.
Thus,
for
example,
having
observed
that
when
we
perceive
by
sight
a
certain
round
luminous
figure
we
at
the
same
time
perceive
by
touch
the
idea
or
sensation
called
heat,
we
do
from
thence
conclude
the
sun
to
be
the
cause
of
heat.
And
in
like
manner
perceiving
the
motion
and
collision
of
bodies
to
be
attended
with
sound,
we
are
inclined
to
think
the
latter
the
effect
of
the
former.
33.
The
ideas
imprinted
on
the
Senses
by
the
Author
of
nature
are
called
real
things;
and
those
excited
in
the
imagination
being
less
regular,
vivid,
and
constant,
are
more
properly
termed
ideas,
or
images
of
things,
which
they
copy
and
represent.
But
then
our
sensations,
be
they
never
so
vivid
and
distinct,
are
nevertheless
ideas,
that
is,
they
exist
in
the
mind,
or
are
perceived
by
it,
as
truly
as
the
ideas
of
its
own
framing.
The
ideas
of
Sense
are
allowed
to
have
more
reality
in
them,
that
is,
to
be
more
strong,
orderly,
and
coherent
than
the
creatures
of
the
mind;
but
this
is
no
argument
that
they
exist
without
the
mind.
They
are
also
less
dependent
on
the
spirit,
or
thinking
substance
which
perceives
them,
in
that
they
are
excited
by
the
will
of
another
and
more
powerful
spirit;
yet
still
they
are
ideas,
and
certainly
no
idea,
whether
faint
or
strong,
can
exist
otherwise
than
in
a
mind
perceiving
it.
34.
Before
we
proceed
any
farther
it
is
necessary
we
spend
some
time
in
answering
objections
which
may
probably
be
made
against
the
principles
we
have
hitherto
laid
down.
In
doing
of
which,
if
I
seem
too
prolix
to
those
of
quick
apprehensions,
I
hope
it
may
be
pardoned,
since
all
men
do
not
equally
apprehend
things
of
this
nature,
and
I
am
willing
to
be
understood
by
every
one.
First,
then,
it
will
be
objected
that
by
the
foregoing
principles
all
that
is
real
and
substantial
in
nature
is
banished
out
of
the
world,
and
instead
thereof
a
chimerical
scheme
of
ideas
takes
place.
All
things
that
exist,
exist
only
in
the
mind,
that
is,
they
are
purely
notional.
What
therefore
becomes
of
the
sun,
moon
and
stars?
What
must
we
think
of
houses,
rivers,
mountains,
trees,
stones;
nay,
even
of
our
own
bodies?
Are
all
these
but
so
many
chimeras
and
illusions
on
the
fancy?
To
all
which,
and
whatever
else
of
the
same
sort
may
be
objected,
I
answer,
that
by
the
principles
premised
we
are
not
deprived
of
any
one
thing
in
nature.
Whatever
we
see,
feel,
hear,
or
anywise
conceive
or
understand
remains
as
secure
as
ever,
and
is
as
real
as
ever.
There
is
a
rerum
natura,
and
the
distinction
between
realities
and
chimeras
retains
its
full
force.
This
is
evident
from
sect.
29,
30,
and
33,
where
we
have
shewn
what
is
meant
by
real
things
in
opposition
to
chimeras
or
ideas
of
our
own
framing;
but
then
they
both
equally
exist
in
the
mind,
and
in
that
sense
they
are
alike
ideas.
35.
I
do
not
argue
against
the
existence
of
any
one
thing
that
we
can
apprehend
either
by
sense
or
reflexion.
That
the
things
I
see
with
my
eyes
and
touch
with
my
hands
do
exist,
really
exist,
I
make
not
the
least
question.
The
only
thing
whose
existence
we
deny
is
that
which
philosophers
call
Matter
or
corporeal
substance.
And
in
doing
of
this
there
is
no
damage
done
to
the
rest
of
mankind,
who,
I
dare
say,
will
never
miss
it.
The
Atheist
indeed
will
want
the
colour
of
an
empty
name
to
support
his
impiety;
and
the
Philosophers
may
possibly
find
they
have
lost
a
great
handle
for
trifling
and
disputation.
36.
If
any
man
thinks
this
detracts
from
the
existence
or
reality
of
things,
he
is
very
far
from
understanding
what
hath
been
premised
in
the
plainest
terms
I
could
think
of.
Take
here
an
abstract
of
what
has
been
said:-
There
are
spiritual
substances,
minds,
or
human
souls,
which
will
or
excite
ideas
in
themselves
at
pleasure;
but
these
are
faint,
weak,
and
unsteady
in
respect
of
others
they
perceive
by
sense-
which,
being
impressed
upon
them
according
to
certain
rules
or
laws
of
nature,
speak
themselves
the
effects
of
a
mind
more
powerful
and
wise
than
human
spirits.
These
latter
are
said
to
have
more
reality
in
them
than
the
former:-
by
which
is
meant
that
they
are
more
affecting,
orderly,
and
distinct,
and
that
they
are
not
fictions
of
the
mind
perceiving
them.
And
in
this
sense
the
sun
that
I
see
by
day
is
the
real
sun,
and
that
which
I
imagine
by
night
is
the
idea
of
the
former.
In
the
sense
here
given
of
reality
it
is
evident
that
every
vegetable,
star,
mineral,
and
in
general
each
part
of
the
mundane
system,
is
as
much
a
real
being
by
our
principles
as
by
any
other.
Whether
others
mean
anything
by
the
term
reality
different
from
what
I
do,
I
entreat
them
to
look
into
their
own
thoughts
and
see.
37.
I
will
be
urged
that
thus
much
at
least
is
true,
to
wit,
that
we
take
away
all
corporeal
substances.
To
this
my
answer
is,
that
if
the
word
substance
be
taken
in
the
vulgar
sense-
for
a
combination
of
sensible
qualities,
such
as
extension,
solidity,
weight,
and
the
like-
this
we
cannot
be
accused
of
taking
away:
but
if
it
be
taken
in
a
philosophic
sense-
for
the
support
of
accidents
or
qualities
without
the
mind-
then
indeed
I
acknowledge
that
we
take
it
away,
if
one
may
be
said
to
take
away
that
which
never
had
any
existence,
not
even
in
the
imagination.
38.
But
after
all,
say
you,
it
sounds
very
harsh
to
say
we
eat
and
drink
ideas,
and
are
clothed
with
ideas.
I
acknowledge
it
does
so-
the
word
idea
not
being
used
in
common
discourse
to
signify
the
several
combinations
of
sensible
qualities
which
are
called
things;
and
it
is
certain
that
any
expression
which
varies
from
the
familiar
use
of
language
will
seem
harsh
and
ridiculous.
But
this
doth
not
concern
the
truth
of
the
proposition,
which
in
other
words
is
no
more
than
to
say,
we
are
fed
and
clothed
with
those
things
which
we
perceive
immediately
by
our
senses.
The
hardness
or
softness,
the
colour,
taste,
warmth,
figure,
or
suchlike
qualities,
which
combined
together
constitute
the
several
sorts
of
victuals
and
apparel,
have
been
shewn
to
exist
only
in
the
mind
that
perceives
them;
and
this
is
all
that
is
meant
by
calling
them
ideas;
which
word
if
it
was
as
ordinarily
used
as
thing,
would
sound
no
harsher
nor
more
ridiculous
than
it.
I
am
not
for
disputing
about
the
propriety,
but
the
truth
of
the
expression.
If
therefore
you
agree
with
me
that
we
eat
and
drink
and
are
clad
with
the
immediate
objects
of
sense,
which
cannot
exist
unperceived
or
without
the
mind,
I
shall
readily
grant
it
is
more
proper
or
conformable
to
custom
that
they
should
be
called
things
rather
than
ideas.
39.
If
it
be
demanded
why
I
make
use
of
the
word
idea,
and
do
not
rather
in
compliance
with
custom
call
them
things;
I
answer,
I
do
it
for
two
reasons:-
first,
because
the
term
thing
in
contra-distinction
to
idea,
is
generally
supposed
to
denote
somewhat
existing
without
the
mind;
secondly,
because
thing
hath
a
more
comprehensive
signification
than
idea,
including
spirit
or
thinking
things
as
well
as
ideas.
Since
therefore
the
objects
of
sense
exist
only
in
the
mind,
and
are
withal
thoughtless
and
inactive,
I
chose
to
mark
them
by
the
word
idea,
which
implies
those
properties.
40.
But,
say
what
we
can,
some
one
perhaps
may
be
apt
to
reply,
he
will
still
believe
his
senses,
and
never
suffer
any
arguments,
how
plausible
soever,
to
prevail
over
the
certainty
of
them.
Be
it
so;
assert
the
evidence
of
sense
as
high
as
you
please,
we
are
willing
to
do
the
same.
That
what
I
see,
hear,
and
feel
doth
exist,
that
is
to
say,
is
perceived
by
me,
I
no
more
doubt
than
I
do
of
my
own
being.
But
I
do
not
see
how
the
testimony
of
sense
can
be
alleged
as
a
proof
for
the
existence
of
anything
which
is
not
perceived
by
sense.
We
are
not
for
having
any
man
turn
sceptic
and
disbelieve
his
senses;
on
the
contrary,
we
give
them
all
the
stress
and
assurance
imaginable;
nor
are
there
any
principles
more
opposite
to
Scepticism
than
those
we
have
laid
down,
as
shall
be
hereafter
clearly
shewn.
41.
Secondly,
it
will
be
objected
that
there
is
a
great
difference
betwixt
real
fire
for
instance,
and
the
idea
of
fire,
betwixt
dreaming
or
imagining
oneself
burnt,
and
actually
being
so:
if
you
suspect
it
to
be
only
the
idea
of
fire
which
you
see,
do
but
put
your
hand
into
it
and
you
will
be
convinced
with
a
witness.
This
and
the
like
may
be
urged
in
opposition
to
our
tenets.
To
all
which
the
answer
is
evident
from
what
hath
been
already
said;
and
I
shall
only
add
in
this
place,
that
if
real
fire
be
very
different
from
the
idea
of
fire,
so
also
is
the
real
pain
that
it
occasions
very
different
from
the
idea
of
the
same
pain,
and
yet
nobody
will
pretend
that
real
pain
either
is,
or
can
possibly
be,
in
an
unperceiving
thing,
or
without
the
mind,
any
more
than
its
idea.
42.
Thirdly,
it
will
be
objected
that
we
see
things
actually
without
or
at
distance
from
us,
and
which
consequently
do
not
exist
in
the
mind;
it
being
absurd
that
those
things
which
are
seen
at
the
distance
of
several
miles
should
be
as
near
to
us
as
our
own
thoughts.
In
answer
to
this,
I
desire
it
may
be
considered
that
in
a
dream
we
do
oft
perceive
things
as
existing
at
a
great
distance
off,
and
yet
for
all
that,
those
things
are
acknowledged
to
have
their
existence
only
in
the
mind.
43.
But,
for
the
fuller
clearing
of
this
point,
it
may
be
worth
while
to
consider
how
it
is
that
we
perceive
distance
and
things
placed
at
a
distance
by
sight.
For,
that
we
should
in
truth
see
external
space,
and
bodies
actually
existing
in
it,
some
nearer,
others
farther
off,
seems
to
carry
with
it
some
opposition
to
what
hath
been
said
of
their
existing
nowhere
without
the
mind.
The
consideration
of
this
difficulty
it
was
that
gave
birth
to
my
"Essay
towards
a
New
Theory
of
Vision,"
which
was
published
not
long
since,
wherein
it
is
shewn
that
distance
or
outness
is
neither
immediately
of
itself
perceived
by
sight,
nor
yet
apprehended
or
judged
of
by
lines
and
angles,
or
anything
that
hath
a
necessary
connexion
with
it;
but
that
it
is
only
suggested
to
our
thoughts
by
certain
visible
ideas
and
sensations
attending
vision,
which
in
their
own
nature
have
no
manner
of
similitude
or
relation
either
with
distance
or
things
placed
at
a
distance;
but,
by
a
connexion
taught
us
by
experience,
they
come
to
signify
and
suggest
them
to
us,
after
the
same
manner
that
words
of
any
language
suggest
the
ideas
they
are
made
to
stand
for;
insomuch
that
a
man
born
blind
and
afterwards
made
to
see,
would
not,
at
first
sight,
think
the
things
he
saw
to
be
without
his
mind,
or
at
any
distance
from
him.
See
sect.
41
of
the
fore-mentioned
treatise.
44.
The
ideas
of
sight
and
touch
make
two
species
entirely
distinct
and
heterogeneous.
The
former
are
marks
and
prognostics
of
the
latter.
That
the
proper
objects
of
sight
neither
exist
without
mind,
nor
are
the
images
of
external
things,
was
shewn
even
in
that
treatise.
Though
throughout
the
same
the
contrary
be
supposed
true
of
tangible
objects-
not
that
to
suppose
that
vulgar
error
was
necessary
for
establishing
the
notion
therein
laid
down,
but
because
it
was
beside
my
purpose
to
examine
and
refute
it
in
a
discourse
concerning
Vision.
So
that
in
strict
truth
the
ideas
of
sight,
when
we
apprehend
by
them
distance
and
things
placed
at
a
distance,
do
not
suggest
or
mark
out
to
us
things
actually
existing
at
a
distance,
but
only
admonish
us
what
ideas
of
touch
will
be
imprinted
in
our
minds
at
such
and
such
distances
of
time,
and
in
consequence
of
such
or
such
actions.
It
is,
I
say,
evident
from
what
has
been
said
in
the
foregoing
parts
of
this
Treatise,
and
in
sect.
147
and
elsewhere
of
the
Essay
concerning
Vision,
that
visible
ideas
are
the
Language
whereby
the
Governing
Spirit
on
whom
we
depend
informs
us
what
tangible
ideas
he
is
about
to
imprint
upon
us,
in
case
we
excite
this
or
that
motion
in
our
own
bodies.
But
for
a
fuller
information
in
this
point
I
refer
to
the
Essay
itself.
45.
Fourthly,
it
will
be
objected
that
from
the
foregoing
principles
it
follows
things
are
every
moment
annihilated
and
created
anew.
The
objects
of
sense
exist
only
when
they
are
perceived;
the
trees
therefore
are
in
the
garden,
or
the
chairs
in
the
parlour,
no
longer
than
while
there
is
somebody
by
to
perceive
them.
Upon
shutting
my
eyes
all
the
furniture
in
the
room
is
reduced
to
nothing,
and
barely
upon
opening
them
it
is
again
created.
In
answer
to
all
which,
I
refer
the
reader
to
what
has
been
said
in
sect.
3,
4,
&c.,
and
desire
he
will
consider
whether
he
means
anything
by
the
actual
existence
of
an
idea
distinct
from
its
being
perceived.
For
my
part,
after
the
nicest
inquiry
I
could
make,
I
am
not
able
to
discover
that
anything
else
is
meant
by
those
words;
and
I
once
more
entreat
the
reader
to
sound
his
own
thoughts,
and
not
suffer
himself
to
be
imposed
on
by
words.
If
he
can
conceive
it
possible
either
for
his
ideas
or
their
archetypes
to
exist
without
being
perceived,
then
I
give
up
the
cause;
but
if
he
cannot,
he
will
acknowledge
it
is
unreasonable
for
him
to
stand
up
in
defence
of
he
knows
not
what,
and
pretend
to
charge
on
me
as
an
absurdity
the
not
assenting
to
those
propositions
which
at
bottom
have
no
meaning
in
them.
46.
It
will
not
be
amiss
to
observe
how
far
the
received
principles
of
philosophy
are
themselves
chargeable
with
those
pretended
absurdities.
It
is
thought
strangely
absurd
that
upon
closing
my
eyelids
all
the
visible
objects
around
me
should
be
reduced
to
nothing;
and
yet
is
not
this
what
philosophers
commonly
acknowledge,
when
they
agree
on
all
hands
that
light
and
colours,
which
alone
are
the
proper
and
immediate
objects
of
sight,
are
mere
sensations
that
exist
no
longer
than
they
are
perceived?
Again,
it
may
to
some
perhaps
seem
very
incredible
that
things
should
be
every
moment
creating,
yet
this
very
notion
is
commonly
taught
in
the
schools.
For
the
Schoolmen,
though
they
acknowledge
the
existence
of
Matter,
and
that
the
whole
mundane
fabric
is
framed
out
of
it,
are
nevertheless
of
opinion
that
it
cannot
subsist
without
the
divine
conservation,
which
by
them
is
expounded
to
be
a
continual
creation.
47.
Farther,
a
little
thought
will
discover
to
us
that
though
we
allow
the
existence
of
Matter
or
corporeal
substance,
yet
it
will
unavoidably
follow,
from
the
principles
which
are
now
generally
admitted,
that
the
particular
bodies,
of
what
kind
soever,
do
none
of
them
exist
whilst
they
are
not
perceived.
For,
it
is
evident
from
sect.
II
and
the
following
sections,
that
the
Matter
philosophers
contend
for
is
an
incomprehensible
somewhat,
which
hath
none
of
those
particular
qualities
whereby
the
bodies
falling
under
our
senses
are
distinguished
one
from
another.
But,
to
make
this
more
plain,
it
must
be
remarked
that
the
infinite
divisibility
of
Matter
is
now
universally
allowed,
at
least
by
the
most
approved
and
considerable
philosophers,
who
on
the
received
principles
demonstrate
it
beyond
all
exception.
Hence,
it
follows
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
parts
in
each
particle
of
Matter
which
are
not
perceived
by
sense.
The
reason
therefore
that
any
particular
body
seems
to
be
of
a
finite
magnitude,
or
exhibits
only
a
finite
number
of
parts
to
sense,
is,
not
because
it
contains
no
more,
since
in
itself
it
contains
an
infinite
number
of
parts,
but
because
the
sense
is
not
acute
enough
to
discern
them.
In
proportion
therefore
as
the
sense
is
rendered
more
acute,
it
perceives
a
greater
number
of
parts
in
the
object,
that
is,
the
object
appears
greater,
and
its
figure
varies,
those
parts
in
its
extremities
which
were
before
unperceivable
appearing
now
to
bound
it
in
very
different
lines
and
angles
from
those
perceived
by
an
obtuser
sense.
And
at
length,
after
various
changes
of
size
and
shape,
when
the
sense
becomes
infinitely
acute
the
body
shall
seem
infinite.
During
all
which
there
is
no
alteration
in
the
body,
but
only
in
the
sense.
Each
body
therefore,
considered
in
itself,
is
infinitely
extended,
and
consequently
void
of
all
shape
or
figure.
From
which
it
follows
that,
though
we
should
grant
the
existence
of
Matter
to
be
never
so
certain,
yet
it
is
withal
as
certain,
the
materialists
themselves
are
by
their
own
principles
forced
to
acknowledge,
that
neither
the
particular
bodies
perceived
by
sense,
nor
anything
like
them,
exists
without
the
mind.
Matter,
I
say,
and
each
particle
thereof,
is
according
to
them
infinite
and
shapeless,
and
it
is
the
mind
that
frames
all
that
variety
of
bodies
which
compose
the
visible
world,
any
one
whereof
does
not
exist
longer
than
it
is
perceived.
48.
If
we
consider
it,
the
objection
proposed
in
sect.
45
will
not
be
found
reasonably
charged
on
the
principles
we
have
premised,
so
as
in
truth
to
make
any
objection
at
all
against
our
notions.
For,
though
we
hold
indeed
the
objects
of
sense
to
be
nothing
else
but
ideas
which
cannot
exist
unperceived;
yet
we
may
not
hence
conclude
they
have
no
existence
except
only
while
they
are
perceived
by
us,
since
there
may
be
some
other
spirit
that
perceives
them
though
we
do
not.
Wherever
bodies
are
said
to
have
no
existence
without
the
mind,
I
would
not
be
understood
to
mean
this
or
that
particular
mind,
but
all
minds
whatsoever.
It
does
not
therefore
follow
from
the
foregoing
principles
that
bodies
are
annihilated
and
created
every
moment,
or
exist
not
at
all
during
the
intervals
between
our
perception
of
them.
49.
Fifthly,
it
may
perhaps
be
objected
that
if
extension
and
figure
exist
only
in
the
mind,
it
follows
that
the
mind
is
extended
and
figured;
since
extension
is
a
mode
or
attribute
which
(to
speak
with
the
schools)
is
predicated
of
the
subject
in
which
it
exists.
I
answer,
those
qualities
are
in
the
mind
only
as
they
are
perceived
by
it-
that
is,
not
by
way
of
mode
or
attribute,
but
only
by
way
of
idea;
and
it
no
more
follows
the
soul
or
mind
is
extended,
because
extension
exists
in
it
alone,
than
it
does
that
it
is
red
or
blue,
because
those
colours
are
on
all
hands
acknowledged
to
exist
in
it,
and
nowhere
else.
As
to
what
philosophers
say
of
subject
and
mode,
that
seems
very
groundless
and
unintelligible.
For
instance,
in
this
proposition
"a
die
is
hard,
extended,
and
square,"
they
will
have
it
that
the
word
die
denotes
a
subject
or
substance,
distinct
from
the
hardness,
extension,
and
figure
which
are
predicated
of
it,
and
in
which
they
exist.
This
I
cannot
comprehend:
to
me
a
die
seems
to
be
nothing
distinct
from
those
things
which
are
termed
its
modes
or
accidents.
And,
to
say
a
die
is
hard,
extended,
and
square
is
not
to
attribute
those
qualities
to
a
subject
distinct
from
and
supporting
them,
but
only
an
explication
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
die.
50.
Sixthly,
you
will
say
there
have
been
a
great
many
things
explained
by
matter
and
motion;
take
away
these
and
you
destroy
the
whole
corpuscular
philosophy,
and
undermine
those
mechanical
principles
which
have
been
applied
with
so
much
success
to
account
for
the
phenomena.
In
short,
whatever
advances
have
been
made,
either
by
ancient
or
modern
philosophers,
in
the
study
of
nature
do
all
proceed
on
the
supposition
that
corporeal
substance
or
Matter
doth
really
exist.
To
this
I
answer
that
there
is
not
any
one
phenomenon
explained
on
that
supposition
which
may
not
as
well
be
explained
without
it,
as
might
easily
be
made
appear
by
an
induction
of
particulars.
To
explain
the
phenomena,
is
all
one
as
to
shew
why,
upon
such
and
such
occasions,
we
are
affected
with
such
and
such
ideas.
But
how
Matter
should
operate
on
a
Spirit,
or
produce
any
idea
in
it,
is
what
no
philosopher
will
pretend
to
explain;
it
is
therefore
evident
there
can
be
no
use
of
Matter
in
natural
philosophy.
Besides,
they
who
attempt
to
account
for
things
do
it
not
by
corporeal
substance,
but
by
figure,
motion,
and
other
qualities,
which
are
in
truth
no
more
than
mere
ideas,
and,
therefore,
cannot
be
the
cause
of
anything,
as
hath
been
already
shewn.
See
sect.
25.
51.
Seventhly,
it
will
upon
this
be
demanded
whether
it
does
not
seem
absurd
to
take
away
natural
causes,
and
ascribe
everything
to
the
immediate
operation
of
Spirits?
We
must
no
longer
say
upon
these
principles
that
fire
heats,
or
water
cools,
but
that
a
Spirit
heats,
and
so
forth.
Would
not
a
man
be
deservedly
laughed
at,
who
should
talk
after
this
manner?
I
answer,
he
would
so;
in
such
things
we
ought
to
"think
with
the
learned,
and
speak
with
the
vulgar."
They
who
to
demonstration
are
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
Copernican
system
do
nevertheless
say
"the
sun
rises,"
"the
sun
sets,"
or
"comes
to
the
meridian";
and
if
they
affected
a
contrary
style
in
common
talk
it
would
without
doubt
appear
very
ridiculous.
A
little
reflexion
on
what
is
here
said
will
make
it
manifest
that
the
common
use
of
language
would
receive
no
manner
of
alteration
or
disturbance
from
the
admission
of
our
tenets.
52.
In
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life,
any
phrases
may
be
retained,
so
long
as
they
excite
in
us
proper
sentiments,
or
dispositions
to
act
in
such
a
manner
as
is
necessary
for
our
well-being,
how
false
soever
they
may
be
if
taken
in
a
strict
and
speculative
sense.
Nay,
this
is
unavoidable,
since,
propriety
being
regulated
by
custom,
language
is
suited
to
the
received
opinions,
which
are
not
always
the
truest.
Hence
it
is
impossible,
even
in
the
most
rigid,
philosophic
reasonings,
so
far
to
alter
the
bent
and
genius
of
the
tongue
we
speak,
as
never
to
give
a
handle
for
cavillers
to
pretend
difficulties
and
inconsistencies.
But,
a
fair
and
ingenuous
reader
will
collect
the
sense
from
the
scope
and
tenor
and
connexion
of
a
discourse,
making
allowances
for
those
inaccurate
modes
of
speech
which
use
has
made
inevitable.
53.
As
to
the
opinion
that
there
are
no
Corporeal
Causes,
this
has
been
heretofore
maintained
by
some
of
the
Schoolmen,
as
it
is
of
late
by
others
among
the
modern
philosophers,
who
though
they
allow
Matter
to
exist,
yet
will
have
God
alone
to
be
the
immediate
efficient
cause
of
all
things.
These
men
saw
that
amongst
all
the
objects
of
sense
there
was
none
which
had
any
power
or
activity
included
in
it;
and
that
by
consequence
this
was
likewise
true
of
whatever
bodies
they
supposed
to
exist
without
the
mind,
like
unto
the
immediate
objects
of
sense.
But
then,
that
they
should
suppose
an
innumerable
multitude
of
created
beings,
which
they
acknowledge
are
not
capable
of
producing
any
one
effect
in
nature,
and
which
therefore
are
made
to
no
manner
of
purpose,
since
God
might
have
done
everything
as
well
without
them:
this
I
say,
though
we
should
allow
it
possible,
must
yet
be
a
very
unaccountable
and
extravagant
supposition.
54.
In
the
eighth
place,
the
universal
concurrent
assent
of
mankind
may
be
thought
by
some
an
invincible
argument
in
behalf
of
Matter,
or
the
existence
of
external
things.
Must
we
suppose
the
whole
world
to
be
mistaken?
And
if
so,
what
cause
can
be
assigned
of
so
widespread
and
predominant
an
error?
I
answer,
first,
that,
upon
a
narrow
inquiry,
it
will
not
perhaps
be
found
so
many
as
is
imagined
do
really
believe
the
existence
of
Matter
or
things
without
the
mind.
Strictly
speaking,
to
believe
that
which
involves
a
contradiction,
or
has
no
meaning
in
it,
is
impossible;
and
whether
the
foregoing
expressions
are
not
of
that
sort,
I
refer
it
to
the
impartial
examination
of
the
reader.
In
one
sense,
indeed,
men
may
be
said
to
believe
that
Matter
exists,
that
is,
they
act
as
if
the
immediate
cause
of
their
sensations,
which
affects
them
every
moment,
and
is
so
nearly
present
to
them,
were
some
senseless
unthinking
being.
But,
that
they
should
clearly
apprehend
any
meaning
marked
by
those
words,
and
form
thereof
a
settled
speculative
opinion,
is
what
I
am
not
able
to
conceive.
This
is
not
the
only
instance
wherein
men
impose
upon
themselves,
by
imagining
they
believe
those
propositions
which
they
have
often
heard,
though
at
bottom
they
have
no
meaning
in
them.
55.
But
secondly,
though
we
should
grant
a
notion
to
be
never
so
universally
and
steadfastly
adhered
to,
yet
this
is
weak
argument
of
its
truth
to
whoever
considers
what
a
vast
number
of
prejudices
and
false
opinions
are
everywhere
embraced
with
the
utmost
tenaciousness,
by
the
unreflecting
(which
are
the
far
greater)
part
of
mankind.
There
was
a
time
when
the
antipodes
and
motion
of
the
earth
were
looked
upon
as
monstrous
absurdities
even
by
men
of
learning:
and
if
it
be
considered
what
a
small
proportion
they
bear
to
the
rest
of
mankind,
we
shall
find
that
at
this
day
those
notions
have
gained
but
a
very
inconsiderable
footing
in
the
world.
56.
But
it
is
demanded
that
we
assign
a
cause
of
this
prejudice,
and
account
for
its
obtaining
in
the
world.
To
this
I
answer,
that
men
knowing
they
perceived
several
ideas,
whereof
they
themselves
were
not
the
authors-
as
not
being
excited
from
within
nor
depending
on
the
operation
of
their
wills-
this
made
them
maintain
those
ideas,
or
objects
of
perception
had
an
existence
independent
of
and
without
the
mind,
without
ever
dreaming
that
a
contradiction
was
involved
in
those
words.
But,
philosophers
having
plainly
seen
that
the
immediate
objects
of
perception
do
not
exist
without
the
mind,
they
in
some
degree
corrected
the
mistake
of
the
vulgar;
but
at
the
same
time
run
into
another
which
seems
no
less
absurd,
to
wit,
that
there
are
certain
objects
really
existing
without
the
mind,
or
having
a
subsistence
distinct
from
being
perceived,
of
which
our
ideas
are
only
images
or
resemblances,
imprinted
by
those
objects
on
the
mind.
And
this
notion
of
the
philosophers
owes
its
origin
to
the
same
cause
with
the
former,
namely,
their
being
conscious
that
they
were
not
the
authors
of
their
own
sensations,
which
they
evidently
knew
were
imprinted
from
without,
and
which
therefore
must
have
some
cause
distinct
from
the
minds
on
which
they
are
imprinted.
57.
But
why
they
should
suppose
the
ideas
of
sense
to
be
excited
in
us
by
things
in
their
likeness,
and
not
rather
have
recourse
to
Spirit
which
alone
can
act,
may
be
accounted
for,
first,
because
they
were
not
aware
of
the
repugnancy
there
is,
as
well
in
supposing
things
like
unto
our
ideas
existing
without,
as
in
attributing
to
them
power
or
activity.
Secondly,
because
the
Supreme
Spirit
which
excites
those
ideas
in
our
minds,
is
not
marked
out
and
limited
to
our
view
by
any
particular
finite
collection
of
sensible
ideas,
as
human
agents
are
by
their
size,
complexion,
limbs,
and
motions.
And
thirdly,
because
His
operations
are
regular
and
uniform.
Whenever
the
course
of
nature
is
interrupted
by
a
miracle,
men
are
ready
to
own
the
presence
of
a
superior
agent.
But,
when
we
see
things
go
on
in
the
ordinary
course
they
do
not
excite
in
us
any
reflexion;
their
order
and
concatenation,
though
it
be
an
argument
of
the
greatest
wisdom,
power,
and
goodness
in
their
creator,
is
yet
so
constant
and
familiar
to
us
that
we
do
not
think
them
the
immediate
effects
of
a
Free
Spirit;
especially
since
inconsistency
and
mutability
in
acting,
though
it
be
an
imperfection,
is
looked
on
as
a
mark
of
freedom.
58.
Tenthly,
it
will
be
objected
that
the
notions
we
advance
are
inconsistent
with
several
sound
truths
in
philosophy
and
mathematics.
For
example,
the
motion
of
the
earth
is
now
universally
admitted
by
astronomers
as
a
truth
grounded
on
the
clearest
and
most
convincing
reasons.
But,
on
the
foregoing
principles,
there
can
be
no
such
thing.
For,
motion
being
only
an
idea,
it
follows
that
if
it
be
not
perceived
it
exists
not;
but
the
motion
of
the
earth
is
not
perceived
by
sense.
I
answer,
that
tenet,
if
rightly
understood,
will
be
found
to
agree
with
the
principles
we
have
premised;
for,
the
question
whether
the
earth
moves
or
no
amounts
in
reality
to
no
more
than
this,
to
wit,
whether
we
have
reason
to
conclude,
from
what
has
been
observed
by
astronomers,
that
if
we
were
placed
in
such
and
such
circumstances,
and
such
or
such
a
position
and
distance
both
from
the
earth
and
sun,
we
should
perceive
the
former
to
move
among
the
choir
of
the
planets,
and
appearing
in
all
respects
like
one
of
them;
and
this,
by
the
established
rules
of
nature
which
we
have
no
reason
to
mistrust,
is
reasonably
collected
from
the
phenomena.
59.
We
may,
from
the
experience
we
have
had
of
the
train
and
succession
of
ideas
in
our
minds,
often
make,
I
will
not
say
uncertain
conjectures,
but
sure
and
well-grounded
predictions
concerning
the
ideas
we
shall
be
affected
with
pursuant
to
a
great
train
of
actions,
and
be
enabled
to
pass
a
right
judgment
of
what
would
have
appeared
to
us,
in
case
we
were
placed
in
circumstances
very
different
from
those
we
are
in
at
present.
Herein
consists
the
knowledge
of
nature,
which
may
preserve
its
use
and
certainty
very
consistently
with
what
hath
been
said.
It
will
be
easy
to
apply
this
to
whatever
objections
of
the
like
sort
may
be
drawn
from
the
magnitude
of
the
stars,
or
any
other
discoveries
in
astronomy
or
nature.
60.
In
the
eleventh
place,
it
will
be
demanded
to
what
purpose
serves
that
curious
organization
of
plants,
and
the
animal
mechanism
in
the
parts
of
animals;
might
not
vegetables
grow,
and
shoot
forth
leaves
of
blossoms,
and
animals
perform
all
their
motions
as
well
without
as
with
all
that
variety
of
internal
parts
so
elegantly
contrived
and
put
together;
which,
being
ideas,
have
nothing
powerful
or
operative
in
them,
nor
have
any
necessary
connexion
with
the
effects
ascribed
to
them?
If
it
be
a
Spirit
that
immediately
produces
every
effect
by
a
fiat
or
act
of
his
will,
we
must
think
all
that
is
fine
and
artificial
in
the
works,
whether
of
man
or
nature,
to
be
made
in
vain.
By
this
doctrine,
though
an
artist
hath
made
the
spring
and
wheels,
and
every
movement
of
a
watch,
and
adjusted
them
in
such
a
manner
as
he
knew
would
produce
the
motions
he
designed,
yet
he
must
think
all
this
done
to
no
purpose,
and
that
it
is
an
Intelligence
which
directs
the
index,
and
points
to
the
hour
of
the
day.
If
so,
why
may
not
the
Intelligence
do
it,
without
his
being
at
the
pains
of
making
the
movements
and
putting
them
together?
Why
does
not
an
empty
case
serve
as
well
as
another?
And
how
comes
it
to
pass
that
whenever
there
is
any
fault
in
the
going
of
a
watch,
there
is
some
corresponding
disorder
to
be
found
in
the
movements,
which
being
mended
by
a
skilful
hand
all
is
right
again?
The
like
may
be
said
of
all
the
clockwork
of
nature,
great
part
whereof
is
so
wonderfully
fine
and
subtle
as
scarce
to
be
discerned
by
the
best
microscope.
In
short,
it
will
be
asked,
how,
upon
our
principles,
any
tolerable
account
can
be
given,
or
any
final
cause
assigned
of
an
innumerable
multitude
of
bodies
and
machines,
framed
with
the
most
exquisite
art,
which
in
the
common
philosophy
have
very
apposite
uses
assigned
them,
and
serve
to
explain
abundance
of
phenomena?
61.
To
all
which
I
answer,
first,
that
though
there
were
some
difficulties
relating
to
the
administration
of
Providence,
and
the
uses
by
it
assigned
to
the
several
parts
of
nature,
which
I
could
not
solve
by
the
foregoing
principles,
yet
this
objection
could
be
of
small
weight
against
the
truth
and
certainty
of
those
things
which
may
be
proved
a
priori,
with
the
utmost
evidence
and
rigor
of
demonstration.
Secondly,
but
neither
are
the
received
principles
free
from
the
like
difficulties;
for,
it
may
still
be
demanded
to
what
end
God
should
take
those
roundabout
methods
of
effecting
things
by
instruments
and
machines,
which
no
one
can
deny
might
have
been
effected
by
the
mere
command
of
His
will
without
all
that
apparatus;
nay,
if
we
narrowly
consider
it,
we
shall
find
the
objection
may
be
retorted
with
greater
force
on
those
who
hold
the
existence
of
those
machines
without
of
mind;
for
it
has
been
made
evident
that
solidity,
bulk,
figure,
motion,
and
the
like
have
no
activity
or
efficacy
in
them,
so
as
to
be
capable
of
producing
any
one
effect
in
nature.
See
sect.
25.
Whoever
therefore
supposes
them
to
exist
(allowing
the
supposition
possible)
when
they
are
not
perceived
does
it
manifestly
to
no
purpose;
since
the
only
use
that
is
assigned
to
them,
as
they
exist
unperceived,
is
that
they
produce
those
perceivable
effects
which
in
truth
cannot
be
ascribed
to
anything
but
Spirit.
62.
But,
to
come
nigher
the
difficulty,
it
must
be
observed
that
though
the
fabrication
of
all
those
parts
and
organs
be
not
absolutely
necessary
to
the
producing
any
effect,
yet
it
is
necessary
to
the
producing
of
things
in
a
constant
regular
way
according
to
the
laws
of
nature.
There
are
certain
general
laws
that
run
through
the
whole
chain
of
natural
effects;
these
are
learned
by
the
observation
and
study
of
nature,
and
are
by
men
applied
as
well
to
the
framing
artificial
things
for
the
use
and
ornament
of
life
as
to
the
explaining
various
phenomena-
which
explication
consists
only
in
shewing
the
conformity
any
particular
phenomenon
hath
to
the
general
laws
of
nature,
or,
which
is
the
same
thing,
in
discovering
the
uniformity
there
is
in
the
production
of
natural
effects;
as
will
be
evident
to
whoever
shall
attend
to
the
several
instances
wherein
philosophers
pretend
to
account
for
appearances.
That
there
is
a
great
and
conspicuous
use
in
these
regular
constant
methods
of
working
observed
by
the
Supreme
Agent
hath
been
shewn
in
sect.
31.
And
it
is
no
less
visible
that
a
particular
size,
figure,
motion,
and
disposition
of
parts
are
necessary,
though
not
absolutely
to
the
producing
any
effect,
yet
to
the
producing
it
according
to
the
standing
mechanical
laws
of
nature.
Thus,
for
instance,
it
cannot
be
denied
that
God,
or
the
Intelligence
that
sustains
and
rules
the
ordinary
course
of
things,
might
if
He
were
minded
to
produce
a
miracle,
cause
all
the
motions
on
the
dial-plate
of
a
watch,
though
nobody
had
ever
made
the
movements
and
put
them
in
it:
but
yet,
if
He
will
act
agreeably
to
the
rules
of
mechanism,
by
Him
for
wise
ends
established
and
maintained
in
the
creation,
it
is
necessary
that
those
actions
of
the
watchmaker,
whereby
he
makes
the
movements
and
rightly
adjusts
them,
precede
the
production
of
the
aforesaid
motions;
as
also
that
any
disorder
in
them
be
attended
with
the
perception
of
some
corresponding
disorder
in
the
movements,
which
being
once
corrected
all
is
right
again.
63.
It
may
indeed
on
some
occasions
be
necessary
that
the
Author
of
nature
display
His
overruling
power
in
producing
some
appearance
out
of
the
ordinary
series
of
things.
Such
exceptions
from
the
general
rules
of
nature
are
proper
to
surprise
and
awe
men
into
an
acknowledgement
of
the
Divine
Being;
but
then
they
are
to
be
used
but
seldom,
otherwise
there
is
a
plain
reason
why
they
should
fail
of
that
effect.
Besides,
God
seems
to
choose
the
convincing
our
reason
of
His
attributes
by
the
works
of
nature,
which
discover
so
much
harmony
and
contrivance
in
their
make,
and
are
such
plain
indications
of
wisdom
and
beneficence
in
their
Author,
rather
than
to
astonish
us
into
a
belief
of
His
Being
by
anomalous
and
surprising
events.
64.
To
set
this
matter
in
a
yet
clearer
light,
I
shall
observe
that
what
has
been
objected
in
sect.
60
amounts
in
reality
to
no
more
than
this:-
ideas
are
not
anyhow
and
at
random
produced,
there
being
a
certain
order
and
connexion
between
them,
like
to
that
of
cause
and
effect;
there
are
also
several
combinations
of
them
made
in
a
very
regular
and
artificial
manner,
which
seem
like
so
many
instruments
in
the
hand
of
nature
that,
being
hid
as
it
were
behind
the
scenes,
have
a
secret
operation
in
producing
those
appearances
which
are
seen
on
the
theatre
of
the
world,
being
themselves
discernible
only
to
the
curious
eye
of
the
philosopher.
But,
since
one
idea
cannot
be
the
cause
of
another,
to
what
purpose
is
that
connexion?
And,
since
those
instruments,
being
barely
inefficacious
perceptions
in
the
mind,
are
not
subservient
to
the
production
of
natural
effects,
it
is
demanded
why
they
are
made;
or,
in
other
words,
what
reason
can
be
assigned
why
God
should
make
us,
upon
a
close
inspection
into
His
works,
behold
so
great
variety
of
ideas
so
artfully
laid
together,
and
so
much
according
to
rule;
it
not
being
credible
that
He
would
be
at
the
expense
(if
one
may
so
speak)
of
all
that
art
and
regularity
to
no
purpose.
65.
To
all
which
my
answer
is,
first,
that
the
connexion
of
ideas
does
not
imply
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect,
but
only
of
a
mark
or
sign
with
the
thing
signified.
The
fire
which
I
see
is
not
the
cause
of
the
pain
I
suffer
upon
my
approaching
it,
but
the
mark
that
forewarns
me
of
it.
In
like
manner
the
noise
that
I
hear
is
not
the
effect
of
this
or
that
motion
or
collision
of
the
ambient
bodies,
but
the
sign
thereof.
Secondly,
the
reason
why
ideas
are
formed
into
machines,
that
is,
artificial
and
regular
combinations,
is
the
same
with
that
for
combining
letters
into
words.
That
a
few
original
ideas
may
be
made
to
signify
a
great
number
of
effects
and
actions,
it
is
necessary
they
be
variously
combined
together.
And,
to
the
end
their
use
be
permanent
and
universal,
these
combinations
must
be
made
by
rule,
and
with
wise
contrivance.
By
this
means
abundance
of
information
is
conveyed
unto
us,
concerning
what
we
are
to
expect
from
such
and
such
actions
and
what
methods
are
proper
to
be
taken
for
the
exciting
such
and
such
ideas;
which
in
effect
is
all
that
I
conceive
to
be
distinctly
meant
when
it
is
said
that,
by
discerning
a
figure,
texture,
and
mechanism
of
the
inward
parts
of
bodies,
whether
natural
or
artificial,
we
may
attain
to
know
the
several
uses
and
properties
depending
thereon,
or
the
nature
of
the
thing.
66.
Hence,
it
is
evident
that
those
things
which,
under
the
notion
of
a
cause
co-operating
or
concurring
to
the
production
of
effects,
are
altogether
inexplicable,
and
run
us
into
great
absurdities,
may
be
very
naturally
explained,
and
have
a
proper
and
obvious
use
assigned
to
them,
when
they
are
considered
only
as
marks
or
signs
for
our
information.
And
it
is
the
searching
after
and
endeavouring
to
understand
those
signs
instituted
by
the
Author
of
Nature,
that
ought
to
be
the
employment
of
the
natural
philosopher;
and
not
the
pretending
to
explain
things
by
corporeal
causes,
which
doctrine
seems
to
have
too
much
estranged
the
minds
of
men
from
that
active
principle,
that
supreme
and
wise
Spirit
"in
whom
we
live,
move,
and
have
our
being."
67.
In
the
twelfth
place,
it
may
perhaps
be
objected
that-
though
it
be
clear
from
what
has
been
said
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
an
inert,
senseless,
extended,
solid,
figured,
movable
substance
existing
without
the
mind,
such
as
philosophers
describe
Matter-
yet,
if
any
man
shall
leave
out
of
his
idea
of
matter
the
positive
ideas
of
extension,
figure,
solidity
and
motion,
and
say
that
he
means
only
by
that
word
an
inert,
senseless
substance,
that
exists
without
the
mind
or
unperceived,
which
is
the
occasion
of
our
ideas,
or
at
the
presence
whereof
God
is
pleased
to
excite
ideas
in
us:
it
doth
not
appear
but
that
Matter
taken
in
this
sense
may
possibly
exist.
In
answer
to
which
I
say,
first,
that
it
seems
no
less
absurd
to
suppose
a
substance
without
accidents,
than
it
is
to
suppose
accidents
without
a
substance.
But
secondly,
though
we
should
grant
this
unknown
substance
may
possibly
exist,
yet
where
can
it
be
supposed
to
be?
That
it
exists
not
in
the
mind
is
agreed;
and
that
it
exists
not
in
place
is
no
less
certain-
since
all
place
or
extension
exists
only
in
the
mind,
as
hath
been
already
proved.
It
remains
therefore
that
it
exists
nowhere
at
all.
68.
Let
us
examine
a
little
the
description
that
is
here
given
us
of
matter.
It
neither
acts,
nor
perceives,
nor
is
perceived;
for
this
is
all
that
is
meant
by
saying
it
is
an
inert,
senseless,
unknown
substance;
which
is
a
definition
entirely
made
up
of
negatives,
excepting
only
the
relative
notion
of
its
standing
under
or
supporting.
But
then
it
must
be
observed
that
it
supports
nothing
at
all,
and
how
nearly
this
comes
to
the
description
of
a
nonentity
I
desire
may
be
considered.
But,
say
you,
it
is
the
unknown
occasion,
at
the
presence
of
which
ideas
are
excited
in
us
by
the
will
of
God.
Now,
I
would
fain
know
how
anything
can
be
present
to
us,
which
is
neither
perceivable
by
sense
nor
reflexion,
nor
capable
of
producing
any
idea
in
our
minds,
nor
is
at
all
extended,
nor
hath
any
form,
nor
exists
in
any
place.
The
words
"to
be
present,"
when
thus
applied,
must
needs
be
taken
in
some
abstract
and
strange
meaning,
and
which
I
am
not
able
to
comprehend.
69.
Again,
let
us
examine
what
is
meant
by
occasion.
So
far
as
I
can
gather
from
the
common
use
of
language,
that
word
signifies
either
the
agent
which
produces
any
effect,
or
else
something
that
is
observed
to
accompany
or
go
before
it
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things.
But
when
it
is
applied
to
Matter
as
above
described,
it
can
be
taken
in
neither
of
those
senses;
for
Matter
is
said
to
be
passive
and
inert,
and
so
cannot
be
an
agent
or
efficient
cause.
It
is
also
unperceivable,
as
being
devoid
of
all
sensible
qualities,
and
so
cannot
be
the
occasion
of
our
perceptions
in
the
latter
sense:
as
when
the
burning
my
finger
is
said
to
be
the
occasion
of
the
pain
that
attends
it.
What
therefore
can
be
meant
by
calling
matter
an
occasion?
The
term
is
either
used
in
no
sense
at
all,
or
else
in
some
very
distant
from
its
received
signification.
70.
You
will
Perhaps
say
that
Matter,
though
it
be
not
perceived
by
us,
is
nevertheless
perceived
by
God,
to
whom
it
is
the
occasion
of
exciting
ideas
in
our
minds.
For,
say
you,
since
we
observe
our
sensations
to
be
imprinted
in
an
orderly
and
constant
manner,
it
is
but
reasonable
to
suppose
there
are
certain
constant
and
regular
occasions
of
their
being
produced.
That
is
to
say,
that
there
are
certain
permanent
and
distinct
parcels
of
Matter,
corresponding
to
our
ideas,
which,
though
they
do
not
excite
them
in
our
minds,
or
anywise
immediately
affect
us,
as
being
altogether
passive
and
unperceivable
to
us,
they
are
nevertheless
to
God,
by
whom
they
art
perceived,
as
it
were
so
many
occasions
to
remind
Him
when
and
what
ideas
to
imprint
on
our
minds;
that
so
things
may
go
on
in
a
constant
uniform
manner.
71.
In
answer
to
this,
I
observe
that,
as
the
notion
of
Matter
is
here
stated,
the
question
is
no
longer
concerning
the
existence
of
a
thing
distinct
from
Spirit
and
idea,
from
perceiving
and
being
perceived;
but
whether
there
are
not
certain
ideas
of
I
know
not
what
sort,
in
the
mind
of
God
which
are
so
many
marks
or
notes
that
direct
Him
how
to
produce
sensations
in
our
minds
in
a
constant
and
regular
method-
much
after
the
same
manner
as
a
musician
is
directed
by
the
notes
of
music
to
produce
that
harmonious
train
and
composition
of
sound
which
is
called
a
tune,
though
they
who
hear
the
music
do
not
perceive
the
notes,
and
may
be
entirely
ignorant
of
them.
But,
this
notion
of
Matter
seems
too
extravagant
to
deserve
a
confutation.
Besides,
it
is
in
effect
no
objection
against
what
we
have
advanced,
viz.
that
there
is
no
senseless
unperceived
substance.
72.
If
we
follow
the
light
of
reason,
we
shall,
from
the
constant
uniform
method
of
our
sensations,
collect
the
goodness
and
wisdom
of
the
Spirit
who
excites
them
in
our
minds;
but
this
is
all
that
I
can
see
reasonably
concluded
from
thence.
To
me,
I
say,
it
is
evident
that
the
being
of
a
spirit
infinitely
wise,
good,
and
powerful
is
abundantly
sufficient
to
explain
all
the
appearances
of
nature.
But,
as
for
inert,
senseless
Matter,
nothing
that
I
perceive
has
any
the
least
connexion
with
it,
or
leads
to
the
thoughts
of
it.
And
I
would
fain
see
any
one
explain
any
the
meanest
phenomenon
in
nature
by
it,
or
shew
any
manner
of
reason,
though
in
the
lowest
rank
of
probability,
that
he
can
have
for
its
existence,
or
even
make
any
tolerable
sense
or
meaning
of
that
supposition.
For,
as
to
its
being
an
occasion,
we
have,
I
think,
evidently
shewn
that
with
regard
to
us
it
is
no
occasion.
It
remains
therefore
that
it
must
be,
if
at
all,
the
occasion
to
God
of
exciting
ideas
in
us;
and
what
this
amounts
to
we
have
just
now
seen.
73.
It
is
worth
while
to
reflect
a
little
on
the
motives
which
induced
men
to
suppose
the
existence
of
material
substance;
that
so
having
observed
the
gradual
ceasing
and
expiration
of
those
motives
or
reasons,
we
may
proportionably
withdraw
the
assent
that
was
grounded
on
them.
First,
therefore,
it
was
thought
that
colour,
figure,
motion,
and
the
rest
of
the
sensible
qualities
or
accidents,
did
really
exist
without
the
mind;
and
for
this
reason
it
seemed
needful
to
suppose
some
unthinking
substratum
or
substance
wherein
they
did
exist,
since
they
could
not
be
conceived
to
exist
by
themselves.
Afterwards,
in
process
of
time,
men
being
convinced
that
colours,
sounds,
and
the
rest
of
the
sensible,
secondary
qualities
had
no
existence
without
the
mind,
they
stripped
this
substratum
or
material
substance
of
those
qualities,
leaving
only
the
primary
ones,
figure,
motion,
and
suchlike,
which
they
still
conceived
to
exist
without
the
mind,
and
consequently
to
stand
in
need
of
a
material
support.
But,
it
having
been
shewn
that
none
even
of
these
can
possibly
exist
otherwise
than
in
a
Spirit
or
Mind
which
perceives
them
it
follows
that
we
have
no
longer
any
reason
to
suppose
the
being
of
Matter;
nay,
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
there
should
be
any
such
thing,
so
long
as
that
word
is
taken
to
denote
an
unthinking
substratum
of
qualities
or
accidents
wherein
they
exist
without
the
mind.
74.
But
though
it
be
allowed
by
the
materialists
themselves
that
Matter
was
thought
of
only
for
the
sake
of
supporting
accidents,
and,
the
reason
entirely
ceasing,
one
might
expect
the
mind
should
naturally,
and
without
any
reluctance
at
all,
quit
the
belief
of
what
was
solely
grounded
thereon;
yet
the
prejudice
is
riveted
so
deeply
in
our
thoughts,
that
we
can
scarce
tell
how
to
part
with
it,
and
are
therefore
inclined,
since
the
thing
itself
is
indefensible,
at
least
to
retain
the
name,
which
we
apply
to
I
know
not
what
abstracted
and
indefinite
notions
of
being,
or
occasion,
though
without
any
show
of
reason,
at
least
so
far
as
I
can
see.
For,
what
is
there
on
our
part,
or
what
do
we
perceive,
amongst
all
the
ideas,
sensations,
notions
which
are
imprinted
on
our
minds,
either
by
sense
or
reflexion,
from
whence
may
be
inferred
the
existence
of
an
inert,
thoughtless,
unperceived
occasion?
and,
on
the
other
hand,
on
the
part
of
an
All-sufficient
Spirit,
what
can
there
be
that
should
make
us
believe
or
even
suspect
He
is
directed
by
an
inert
occasion
to
excite
ideas
in
our
minds?
75.
It
is
a
very
extraordinary
instance
of
the
force
of
prejudice,
and
much
to
be
lamented,
that
the
mind
of
man
retains
so
great
a
fondness,
against
all
the
evidence
of
reason,
for
a
stupid
thoughtless
somewhat,
by
the
interposition
whereof
it
would
as
it
were
screen
itself
from
the
Providence
of
God,
and
remove
it
farther
off
from
the
affairs
of
the
world.
But,
though
we
do
the
utmost
we
can
to
secure
the
belief
of
Matter,
though,
when
reason
forsakes
us,
we
endeavour
to
support
our
opinion
on
the
bare
possibility
of
the
thing,
and
though
we
indulge
ourselves
in
the
full
scope
of
an
imagination
not
regulated
by
reason
to
make
out
that
poor
possibility,
yet
the
upshot
of
all
is,
that
there
are
certain
unknown
Ideas
in
the
mind
of
God;
for
this,
if
anything,
is
all
that
I
conceive
to
be
meant
by
occasion
with
regard
to
God.
And
this
at
the
bottom
is
no
longer
contending
for
the
thing,
but
for
the
name.
76.
Whether
therefore
there
are
such
Ideas
in
the
mind
of
God,
and
whether
they
may
be
called
by
the
name
Matter,
I
shall
not
dispute.
But,
if
you
stick
to
the
notion
of
an
unthinking
substance
or
support
of
extension,
motion,
and
other
sensible
qualities,
then
to
me
it
is
most
evidently
impossible
there
should
be
any
such
thing,
since
it
is
a
plain
repugnancy
that
those
qualities
should
exist
in
or
be
supported
by
an
unperceiving
substance.
77.
But,
say
you,
though
it
be
granted
that
there
is
no
thoughtless
support
of
extension
and
the
other
qualities
or
accidents
which
we
perceive,
yet
there
may
perhaps
be
some
inert,
unperceiving
substance
or
substratum
of
some
other
qualities,
as
incomprehensible
to
us
as
colours
are
to
a
man
born
blind,
because
we
have
not
a
sense
adapted
to
them.
But,
if
we
had
a
new
sense,
we
should
possibly
no
more
doubt
of
their
existence
than
a
blind
man
made
to
see
does
of
the
existence
of
light
and
colours.
I
answer,
first,
if
what
you
mean
by
the
word
Matter
be
only
the
unknown
support
of
unknown
qualities,
it
is
no
matter
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
or
no,
since
it
no
way
concerns
us;
and
I
do
not
see
the
advantage
there
is
in
disputing
about
what
we
know
not
what,
and
we
know
not
why.
78.
But,
secondly,
if
we
had
a
new
sense
it
could
only
furnish
us
with
new
ideas
or
sensations;
and
then
we
should
have
the
same
reason
against
their
existing
in
an
unperceiving
substance
that
has
been
already
offered
with
relation
to
figure,
motion,
colour
and
the
like.
Qualities,
as
hath
been
shewn,
are
nothing
else
but
sensations
or
ideas,
which
exist
only
in
a
mind
perceiving
them;
and
this
is
true
not
only
of
the
ideas
we
are
acquainted
with
at
present,
but
likewise
of
all
possible
ideas
whatsoever.
79.
But,
you
will
insist,
what
if
I
have
no
reason
to
believe
the
existence
of
Matter?
what
if
I
cannot
assign
any
use
to
it
or
explain
anything
by
it,
or
even
conceive
what
is
meant
by
that
word?
yet
still
it
is
no
contradiction
to
say
that
Matter
exists,
and
that
this
Matter
is
in
general
a
substance,
or
occasion
of
ideas;
though
indeed
to
go
about
to
unfold
the
meaning
or
adhere
to
any
particular
explication
of
those
words
may
be
attended
with
great
difficulties.
I
answer,
when
words
are
used
without
a
meaning,
you
may
put
them
together
as
you
please
without
danger
of
running
into
a
contradiction.
You
may
say,
for
example,
that
twice
two
is
equal
to
seven,
so
long
as
you
declare
you
do
not
take
the
words
of
that
proposition
in
their
usual
acceptation
but
for
marks
of
you
know
not
what.
And,
by
the
same
reason,
you
may
say
there
is
an
inert
thoughtless
substance
without
accidents
which
is
the
occasion
of
our
ideas.
And
we
shall
understand
just
as
much
by
one
proposition
as
the
other.
80.
In
the
last
place,
you
will
say,
what
if
we
give
up
the
cause
of
material
Substance,
and
stand
to
it
that
Matter
is
an
unknown
somewhat-
neither
substance
nor
accident,
spirit
nor
idea,
inert,
thoughtless,
indivisible,
immovable,
unextended,
existing
in
no
place.
For,
say
you,
whatever
may
be
urged
against
substance
or
occasion,
or
any
other
positive
or
relative
notion
of
Matter,
hath
no
place
at
all,
so
long
as
this
negative
definition
of
Matter
is
adhered
to.
I
answer,
you
may,
if
so
it
shall
seem
good,
use
the
word
"Matter"
in
the
same
sense
as
other
men
use
"nothing,"
and
so
make
those
terms
convertible
in
your
style.
For,
after
all,
this
is
what
appears
to
me
to
be
the
result
of
that
definition,
the
parts
whereof
when
I
consider
with
attention,
either
collectively
or
separate
from
each
other,
I
do
not
find
that
there
is
any
kind
of
effect
or
impression
made
on
my
mind
different
from
what
is
excited
by
the
term
nothing.
81.
You
will
reply,
perhaps,
that
in
the
fore-said
definition
is
included
what
doth
sufficiently
distinguish
it
from
nothing-
the
positive
abstract
idea
of
quiddity,
entity,
or
existence.
I
own,
indeed,
that
those
who
pretend
to
the
faculty
of
framing
abstract
general
ideas
do
talk
as
if
they
had
such
an
idea,
which
is,
say
they,
the
most
abstract
and
general
notion
of
all;
that
is,
to
me,
the
most
incomprehensible
of
all
others.
That
there
are
a
great
variety
of
spirits
of
different
orders
and
capacities,
whose
faculties
both
in
number
and
extent
are
far
exceeding
those
the
Author
of
my
being
has
bestowed
on
me,
I
see
no
reason
to
deny.
And
for
me
to
pretend
to
determine
by
my
own
few,
stinted
narrow
inlets
of
perception,
what
ideas
the
inexhaustible
power
of
the
Supreme
Spirit
may
imprint
upon
them
were
certainly
the
utmost
folly
and
presumption-
since
there
may
be,
for
aught
that
I
know,
innumerable
sorts
of
ideas
or
sensations,
as
different
from
one
another,
and
from
all
that
I
have
perceived,
as
colours
are
from
sounds.
But,
how
ready
soever
I
may
be
to
acknowledge
the
scantiness
of
my
comprehension
with
regard
to
the
endless
variety
of
spirits
and
ideas
that
may
possibly
exist,
yet
for
any
one
to
pretend
to
a
notion
of
Entity
or
Existence,
abstracted
from
spirit
and
idea,
from
perceived
and
being
perceived,
is,
I
suspect,
a
downright
repugnancy
and
trifling
with
words.-
It
remains
that
we
consider
the
objections
which
may
possibly
be
made
on
the
part
of
Religion.
82.
Some
there
are
who
think
that,
though
the
arguments
for
the
real
existence
of
bodies
which
are
drawn
from
Reason
be
allowed
not
to
amount
to
demonstration,
yet
the
Holy
Scriptures
are
so
clear
in
the
point
as
will
sufficiently
convince
every
good
Christian
that
bodies
do
really
exist,
and
are
something
more
than
mere
ideas;
there
being
in
Holy
Writ
innumerable
facts
related
which
evidently
suppose
the
reality
of
timber
and
stone,
mountains
and
rivers,
and
cities,
and
human
bodies.
To
which
I
answer
that
no
sort
of
writings
whatever,
sacred
or
profane,
which
use
those
and
the
like
words
in
the
vulgar
acceptation,
or
so
as
to
have
a
meaning
in
them,
are
in
danger
of
having
their
truth
called
in
question
by
our
doctrine.
That
all
those
things
do
really
exist,
that
there
are
bodies,
even
corporeal
substances,
when
taken
in
the
vulgar
sense,
has
been
shewn
to
be
agreeable
to
our
principles;
and
the
difference
betwixt
things
and
ideas,
realities
and
chimeras,
has
been
distinctly
explained.
See
sect.
29,
30,
33,
36,
&c.
And
I
do
not
think
that
either
what
philosophers
call
Matter,
or
the
existence
of
objects
without
the
mind,
is
anywhere
mentioned
in
Scripture.
83.
Again,
whether
there
can
be
or
be
not
external
things,
it
is
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
proper
use
of
words
is
the
marking
our
conceptions,
or
things
only
as
they
are
known
and
perceived
by
us;
whence
it
plainly
follows
that
in
the
tenets
we
have
laid
down
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
right
use
and
significancy
of
language,
and
that
discourse,
of
what
kind
soever,
so
far
as
it
is
intelligible,
remains
undisturbed.
But
all
this
seems
so
manifest,
from
what
has
been
largely
set
forth
in
the
premises,
that
it
is
needless
to
insist
any
farther
on
it.
84.
But,
it
will
be
urged
that
miracles
do,
at
least,
lose
much
of
their
stress
and
import
by
our
principles.
What
must
we
think
of
Moses'
rod?
was
it
not
really
turned
into
a
serpent;
or
was
there
only
a
change
of
ideas
in
the
minds
of
the
spectators?
And,
can
it
be
supposed
that
our
Saviour
did
no
more
at
the
marriage-feast
in
Cana
than
impose
on
the
sight,
and
smell,
and
taste
of
the
guests,
so
as
to
create
in
them
the
appearance
or
idea
only
of
wine?
The
same
may
be
said
of
all
other
miracles;
which,
in
consequence
of
the
foregoing
principles,
must
be
looked
upon
only
as
so
many
cheats,
or
illusions
of
fancy.
To
this
I
reply,
that
the
rod
was
changed
into
a
real
serpent,
and
the
water
into
real
wine.
That
this
does
not
in
the
least
contradict
what
I
have
elsewhere
said
will
be
evident
from
sect.
34
and
35.
But
this
business
of
real
and
imaginary
has
been
already
so
plainly
and
fully
explained,
and
so
often
referred
to,
and
the
difficulties
about
it
are
so
easily
answered
from
what
has
gone
before,
that
it
were
an
affront
to
the
reader's
understanding
to
resume
the
explication
of
it
in
its
place.
I
shall
only
observe
that
if
at
table
all
who
were
present
should
see,
and
smell,
and
taste,
and
drink
wine,
and
find
the
effects
of
it,
with
me
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
its
reality;
so
that
at
bottom
the
scruple
concerning
real
miracles
has
no
place
at
all
on
ours,
but
only
on
the
received
principles,
and
consequently
makes
rather
for
than
against
what
has
been
said.
85.
Having
done
with
the
Objections,
which
I
endeavoured
to
propose
in
the
clearest
light,
and
gave
them
all
the
force
and
weight
I
could,
we
proceed
in
the
next
place
to
take
a
view
of
our
tenets
in
their
Consequences.
Some
of
these
appear
at
first
sight-
as
that
several
difficult
and
obscure
questions,
on
which
abundance
of
speculation
has
been
thrown
away,
are
entirely
banished
from
philosophy.
"Whether
corporeal
substance
can
think,"
"whether
Matter
be
infinitely
divisible,"
and
"how
it
operates
on
spirit"-
these
and
like
inquiries
have
given
infinite
amusement
to
philosophers
in
all
ages;
but
depending
on
the
existence
of
Matter,
they
have
no
longer
any
place
on
our
principles.
Many
other
advantages
there
are,
as
well
with
regard
to
religion
as
the
sciences,
which
it
is
easy
for
any
one
to
deduce
from
what
has
been
premised;
but
this
will
appear
more
plainly
in
the
sequel.
86.
From
the
principles
we
have
laid
down
it
follows
human
knowledge
may
naturally
be
reduced
to
two
heads-
that
of
ideas
and
that
of
spirits.
Of
each
of
these
I
shall
treat
in
order.
And
first
as
to
ideas
or
unthinking
things.
Our
knowledge
of
these
hath
been
very
much
obscured
and
confounded,
and
we
have
been
led
into
very
dangerous
errors,
by
supposing
a
twofold
existence
of
the
objects
of
sense-
the
one
intelligible
or
in
the
mind,
the
other
real
and
without
the
mind;
whereby
unthinking
things
are
thought
to
have
a
natural
subsistence
of
their
own
distinct
from
being
perceived
by
spirits.
This,
which,
if
I
mistake
not,
hath
been
shewn
to
be
a
most
groundless
and
absurd
notion,
is
the
very
root
of
Scepticism;
for,
so
long
as
men
thought
that
real
things
subsisted
without
the
mind,
and
that
their
knowledge
was
only
so
far
forth
real
as
it
was
conformable
to
real
things,
it
follows
they
could
not
be
certain
they
had
any
real
knowledge
at
all.
For
how
can
it
be
known
that
the
things
which
are
perceived
are
conformable
to
those
which
are
not
perceived,
or
exist
without
the
mind?
87.
Colour,
figure,
motion,
extension,
and
the
like,
considered
only
as
so
many
sensations
in
the
mind,
are
perfectly
known,
there
being
nothing
in
them
which
is
not
perceived.
But,
if
they
are
looked
on
as
notes
or
images,
referred
to
things
or
archetypes
existing
without
the
mind,
then
are
we
involved
all
in
scepticism.
We
see
only
the
appearances,
and
not
the
real
qualities
of
things.
What
may
be
the
extension,
figure,
or
motion
of
anything
really
and
absolutely,
or
in
itself,
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
know,
but
only
the
proportion
or
relation
they
bear
to
our
senses.
Things
remaining
the
same,
our
ideas
vary,
and
which
of
them,
or
even
whether
any
of
them
at
all,
represent
the
true
quality
really
existing
in
the
thing,
it
is
out
of
our
reach
to
determine.
So
that,
for
aught
we
know,
all
we
see,
hear,
and
feel
may
be
only
phantom
and
vain
chimera,
and
not
at
all
agree
with
the
real
things
existing
in
rerum
natura.
All
this
scepticism
follows
from
our
supposing
a
difference
between
things
and
ideas,
and
that
the
former
have
a
subsistence
without
the
mind
or
unperceived.
It
were
easy
to
dilate
on
this
subject,
and
show
how
the
arguments
urged
by
sceptics
in
all
ages
depend
on
the
supposition
of
external
objects.
88.
So
long
as
we
attribute
a
real
existence
to
unthinking
things,
distinct
from
their
being
perceived,
it
is
not
only
impossible
for
us
to
know
with
evidence
the
nature
of
any
real
unthinking
being,
but
even
that
it
exists.
Hence
it
is
that
we
see
philosophers
distrust
their
senses,
and
doubt
of
the
existence
of
heaven
and
earth,
of
everything
they
see
or
feel,
even
of
their
own
bodies.
And,
after
all
their
labour
and
struggle
of
thought,
they
are
forced
to
own
we
cannot
attain
to
any
self-evident
or
demonstrative
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
sensible
things.
But,
all
this
doubtfulness,
which
so
bewilders
and
confounds
the
mind
and
makes
philosophy
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
world,
vanishes
if
we
annex
a
meaning
to
our
words.
and
not
amuse
ourselves
with
the
terms
"absolute,"
"external,"
"exist,
"and
such-like,
signifying
we
know
not
what.
I
can
as
well
doubt
of
my
own
being
as
of
the
being
of
those
things
which
I
actually
perceive
by
sense;
it
being
a
manifest
contradiction
that
any
sensible
object
should
be
immediately
perceived
by
sight
or
touch,
and
at
the
same
time
have
no
existence
in
nature,
since
the
very
existence
of
an
unthinking
being
consists
in
being
perceived.
89.
Nothing
seems
of
more
importance
towards
erecting
a
firm
system
of
sound
and
real
knowledge,
which
may
be
proof
against
the
assaults
of
Scepticism,
than
to
lay
the
beginning
in
a
distinct
explication
of
what
is
meant
by
thing,
reality,
existence;
for
in
vain
shall
we
dispute
concerning
the
real
existence
of
things,
or
pretend
to
any
knowledge
thereof,
so
long
as
we
have
not
fixed
the
meaning
of
those
words.
Thing
or
Being
is
the
most
general
name
of
all;
it
comprehends
under
it
two
kinds
entirely
distinct
and
heterogeneous,
and
which
have
nothing
common
but
the
name.
viz.
spirits
and
ideas.
The
former
are
active,
indivisible
substances:
the
latter
are
inert,
fleeting,
dependent
beings,
which
subsist
not
by
themselves,
but
are
supported
by,
or
exist
in
minds
or
spiritual
substances.
We
comprehend
our
own
existence
by
inward
feeling
or
reflexion,
and
that
of
other
spirits
by
reason.
We
may
be
said
to
have
some
knowledge
or
notion
of
our
own
minds,
of
spirits
and
active
beings,
whereof
in
a
strict
sense
we
have
not
ideas.
In
like
manner,
we
know
and
have
a
notion
of
relations
between
things
or
ideas-
which
relations
are
distinct
from
the
ideas
or
things
related,
inasmuch
as
the
latter
may
be
perceived
by
us
without
our
perceiving
the
former.
To
me
it
seems
that
ideas,
spirits,
and
relations
are
all
in
their
respective
kinds
the
object
of
human
knowledge
and
subject
of
discourse;
and
that
the
term
idea
would
be
improperly
extended
to
signify
everything
we
know
or
have
any
notion
of.
90.
Ideas
imprinted
on
the
senses
are
real
things,
or
do
really
exist;
this
we
do
not
deny,
but
we
deny
they
can
subsist
without
the
minds
which
perceive
them,
or
that
they
are
resemblances
of
any
archetypes
existing
without
the
mind;
since
the
very
being
of
a
sensation
or
idea
consists
in
being
perceived,
and
an
idea
can
be
like
nothing
but
an
idea.
Again,
the
things
perceived
by
sense
may
be
termed
external,
with
regard
to
their
origin-
in
that
they
are
not
generated
from
within
by
the
mind
itself,
but
imprinted
by
a
Spirit
distinct
from
that
which
perceives
them.
Sensible
objects
may
likewise
be
said
to
be
"without
the
mind"
in
another
sense,
namely
when
they
exist
in
some
other
mind;
thus,
when
I
shut
my
eyes,
the
things
I
saw
may
still
exist,
but
it
must
be
in
another
mind.
91.
It
were
a
mistake
to
think
that
what
is
here
said
derogates
in
the
least
from
the
reality
of
things.
It
is
acknowledged,
on
the
received
principles,
that
extension,
motion,
and
in
a
word
all
sensible
qualities
have
need
of
a
support,
as
not
being
able
to
subsist
by
themselves.
But
the
objects
perceived
by
sense
are
allowed
to
be
nothing
but
combinations
of
those
qualities,
and
consequently
cannot
subsist
by
themselves.
Thus
far
it
is
agreed
on
all
hand.
So
that
in
denying
the
things
perceived
by
sense
an
existence
independent
of
a
substance
of
support
wherein
they
may
exist,
we
detract
nothing
from
the
received
opinion
of
their
reality,
and
are
guilty
of
no
innovation
in
that
respect.
All
the
difference
is
that,
according
to
us,
the
unthinking
beings
perceived
by
sense
have
no
existence
distinct
from
being
perceived,
and
cannot
therefore
exist
in
any
other
substance
than
those
unextended
indivisible
substances
or
spirits
which
act
and
think
and
perceive
them;
whereas
philosophers
vulgarly
hold
that
the
sensible
qualities
do
exist
in
an
inert,
extended,
unperceiving
substance
which
they
call
Matter,
to
which
they
attribute
a
natural
subsistence,
exterior
to
all
thinking
beings,
or
distinct
from
being
perceived
by
any
mind
whatsoever,
even
the
eternal
mind
of
the
Creator,
wherein
they
suppose
only
ideas
of
the
corporeal
substances
created
by
him;
if
indeed
they
allow
them
to
be
at
all
created.
92.
For,
as
we
have
shewn
the
doctrine
of
Matter
or
corporeal
substance
to
have
been
the
main
pillar
and
support
of
Scepticism,
so
likewise
upon
the
same
foundation
have
been
raised
all
the
impious
schemes
of
Atheism
and
Irreligion.
Nay,
so
great
a
difficulty
has
it
been
thought
to
conceive
Matter
produced
out
of
nothing,
that
the
most
celebrated
among
the
ancient
philosophers,
even
of
those
who
maintained
the
being
of
a
God,
have
thought
Matter
to
be
uncreated
and
co-eternal
with
Him.
How
great
a
friend
material
substance
has
been
to
Atheists
in
all
ages
were
needless
to
relate.
All
their
monstrous
systems
have
so
visible
and
necessary
a
dependence
on
it
that,
when
this
corner-stone
is
once
removed,
the
whole
fabric
cannot
choose
but
fall
to
the
ground,
insomuch
that
it
is
no
longer
worth
while
to
bestow
a
particular
consideration
on
the
absurdities
of
every
wretched
sect
of
Atheists.
93.
That
impious
and
profane
persons
should
readily
fall
in
with
those
systems
which
favour
their
inclinations,
by
deriding
immaterial
substance,
and
supposing
the
soul
to
be
divisible
and
subject
to
corruption
as
the
body;
which
exclude
all
freedom,
intelligence,
and
design
from
the
formation
of
things,
and
instead
thereof
make
a
self-existent,
stupid,
unthinking
substance
the
root
and
origin
of
all
beings;
that
they
should
hearken
to
those
who
deny
a
Providence,
or
inspection
of
a
Superior
Mind
over
the
affairs
of
the
world,
attributing
the
whole
series
of
events
either
to
blind
chance
or
fatal
necessity
arising
from
the
impulse
of
one
body
or
another-
all
this
is
very
natural.
And,
on
the
other
hand,
when
men
of
better
principles
observe
the
enemies
of
religion
lay
so
great
a
stress
on
unthinking
Matter,
and
all
of
them
use
so
much
industry
and
artifice
to
reduce
everything
to
it,
methinks
they
should
rejoice
to
see
them
deprived
of
their
grand
support,
and
driven
from
that
only
fortress,
without
which
your
Epicureans,
Hobbists,
and
the
like,
have
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
pretence,
but
become
the
most
cheap
and
easy
triumph
in
the
world.
94.
The
existence
of
Matter,
or
bodies
unperceived,
has
not
only
been
the
main
support
of
Atheists
and
Fatalists,
but
on
the
same
principle
doth
Idolatry
likewise
in
all
its
various
forms
depend.
Did
men
but
consider
that
the
sun,
moon,
and
stars,
and
every
other
object
of
the
senses
are
only
so
many
sensations
in
their
minds,
which
have
no
other
existence
but
barely
being
perceived,
doubtless
they
would
never
fall
down
and
worship
their
own
ideas,
but
rather
address
their
homage
to
that
ETERNAL
INVISIBLE
MIND
which
produces
and
sustains
all
things.
95.
The
same
absurd
principle,
by
mingling
itself
with
the
articles
of
our
faith,
has
occasioned
no
small
difficulties
to
Christians.
For
example,
about
the
Resurrection,
how
many
scruples
and
objections
have
been
raised
by
Socinians
and
others?
But
do
not
the
most
plausible
of
them
depend
on
the
supposition
that
a
body
is
denominated
the
same,
with
regard
not
to
the
form
or
that
which
is
perceived
by
sense,
but
the
material
substance,
which
remains
the
same
under
several
forms?
Take
away
this
material
substance,
about
the
identity
whereof
all
the
dispute
is,
and
mean
by
body
what
every
plain
ordinary
person
means
by
that
word,
to
wit,
that
which
is
immediately
seen
and
felt,
which
is
only
a
combination
of
sensible
qualities
or
ideas,
and
then
their
most
unanswerable
objections
come
to
nothing.
96.
Matter
being
once
expelled
out
of
nature
drags
with
it
so
many
sceptical
and
impious
notions,
such
an
incredible
number
of
disputes
and
puzzling
questions,
which
have
been
thorns
in
the
sides
of
divines
as
well
as
philosophers,
and
made
so
much
fruitless
work
for
mankind,
that
if
the
arguments
we
have
produced
against
it
are
not
found
equal
to
demonstration
(as
to
me
they
evidently
seem),
yet
I
am
sure
all
friends
to
knowledge,
peace,
and
religion
have
reason
to
wish
they
were.
97.
Beside
the
external
existence
of
the
objects
of
perception,
another
great
source
of
errors
and
difficulties
with
regard
to
ideal
knowledge
is
the
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas,
such
as
it
hath
been
set
forth
in
the
Introduction.
The
plainest
things
in
the
world,
those
we
are
most
intimately
acquainted
with
and
perfectly
know,
when
they
are
considered
in
an
abstract
way,
appear
strangely
difficult
and
incomprehensible.
Time,
place,
and
motion,
taken
in
particular
or
concrete,
are
what
everybody
knows,
but,
having
passed
through
the
hands
of
a
metaphysician,
they
become
too
abstract
and
fine
to
be
apprehended
by
men
of
ordinary
sense.
Bid
your
servant
meet
you
at
such
a
time
in
such
a
place,
and
he
shall
never
stay
to
deliberate
on
the
meaning
of
those
words;
in
conceiving
that
particular
time
and
place,
or
the
motion
by
which
he
is
to
get
thither,
he
finds
not
the
least
difficulty.
But
if
time
be
taken
exclusive
of
all
those
particular
actions
and
ideas
that
diversify
the
day,
merely
for
the
continuation
of
existence
or
duration
in
abstract,
then
it
will
perhaps
gravel
even
a
philosopher
to
comprehend
it.
98.
For
my
own
part,
whenever
I
attempt
to
frame
a
simple
idea
of
time,
abstracted
from
the
succession
of
ideas
in
my
mind,
which
flows
uniformly
and
is
participated
by
all
beings,
I
am
lost
and
embrangled
in
inextricable
difficulties.
I
have
no
notion
of
it
at
all,
only
I
hear
others
say
it
is
infinitely
divisible,
and
speak
of
it
in
such
a
manner
as
leads
me
to
entertain
odd
thoughts
of
my
existence;
since
that
doctrine
lays
one
under
an
absolute
necessity
of
thinking,
either
that
he
passes
away
innumerable
ages
without
a
thought,
or
else
that
he
is
annihilated
every
moment
of
his
life,
both
which
seem
equally
absurd.
Time
therefore
being
nothing,
abstracted
from
the
sucession
of
ideas
in
our
minds,
it
follows
that
the
duration
of
any
finite
spirit
must
be
estimated
by
the
number
of
ideas
or
actions
succeeding
each
other
in
that
same
spirit
or
mind.
Hence,
it
is
a
plain
consequence
that
the
soul
always
thinks;
and
in
truth
whoever
shall
go
about
to
divide
in
his
thoughts,
or
abstract
the
existence
of
a
spirit
from
its
cogitation,
will,
I
believe,
find
it
no
easy
task.
99.
So
likewise
when
we
attempt
to
abstract
extension
and
motion
from
all
other
qualities,
and
consider
them
by
themselves,
we
presently
lose
sight
of
them,
and
run
into
great
extravagances.
All
which
depend
on
a
twofold
abstraction;
first,
it
is
supposed
that
extension,
for
example,
may
be
abstracted
from
all
other
sensible
qualities;
and
secondly,
that
the
entity
of
extension
may
be
abstracted
from
its
being
perceived.
But,
whoever
shall
reflect,
and
take
care
to
understand
what
he
says,
will,
if
I
mistake
not,
acknowledge
that
all
sensible
qualities
are
alike
sensations
and
alike
real;
that
where
the
extension
is,
there
is
the
colour,
too,
i.e.,
in
his
mind,
and
that
their
archetypes
can
exist
only
in
some
other
mind;
and
that
the
objects
of
sense
are
nothing
but
those
sensations
combined,
blended,
or
(if
one
may
so
speak)
concreted
together;
none
of
all
which
can
be
supposed
to
exist
unperceived.
100.
What
it
is
for
a
man
to
be
happy,
or
an
object
good,
every
one
may
think
he
knows.
But
to
frame
an
abstract
idea
of
happiness,
prescinded
from
all
particular
pleasure,
or
of
goodness
from
everything
that
is
good,
this
is
what
few
can
pretend
to.
So
likewise
a
man
may
be
just
and
virtuous
without
having
precise
ideas
of
justice
and
virtue.
The
opinion
that
those
and
the
like
words
stand
for
general
notions,
abstracted
from
all
particular
persons
and
actions,
seems
to
have
rendered
morality
very
difficult,
and
the
study
thereof
of
small
use
to
mankind.
And
in
effect
the
doctrine
of
abstraction
has
not
a
little
contributed
towards
spoiling
the
most
useful
parts
of
knowledge.
101.
The
two
great
provinces
of
speculative
science
conversant
about
ideas
received
from
sense,
are
Natural
Philosophy
and
Mathematics;
with
regard
to
each
of
these
I
shall
make
some
observations.
And
first
I
shall
say
somewhat
of
Natural
Philosophy.
On
this
subject
it
is
that
the
sceptics
triumph.
All
that
stock
of
arguments
they
produce
to
depreciate
our
faculties
and
make
mankind
appear
ignorant
and
low,
are
drawn
principally
from
this
head,
namely,
that
we
are
under
an
invincible
blindness
as
to
the
true
and
real
nature
of
things.
This
they
exaggerate,
and
love
to
enlarge
on.
We
are
miserably
bantered,
say
they,
by
our
senses,
and
amused
only
with
the
outside
and
show
of
things.
The
real
essence,
the
internal
qualities
and
constitution
of
every
the
meanest
object,
is
hid
from
our
view;
something
there
is
in
every
drop
of
water,
every
grain
of
sand,
which
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
human
understanding
to
fathom
or
comprehend.
But,
it
is
evident
from
what
has
been
shewn
that
all
this
complaint
is
groundless,
and
that
we
are
influenced
by
false
principles
to
that
degree
as
to
mistrust
our
senses,
and
think
we
know
nothing
of
those
things
which
we
perfectly
comprehend.
102.
One
great
inducement
to
our
pronouncing
ourselves
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
things
is
the
current
opinion
that
everything
includes
within
itself
the
cause
of
its
properties;
or
that
there
is
in
each
object
an
inward
essence
which
is
the
source
whence
its
discernible
qualities
flow,
and
whereon
they
depend.
Some
have
pretended
to
account
for
appearances
by
occult
qualities,
but
of
late
they
are
mostly
resolved
into
mechanical
causes,
to
wit.
the
figure,
motion,
weight,
and
suchlike
qualities,
of
insensible
particles;
whereas,
in
truth,
there
is
no
other
agent
or
efficient
cause
than
spirit,
it
being
evident
that
motion,
as
well
as
all
other
ideas,
is
perfectly
inert.
See
sect.
25.
Hence,
to
endeavour
to
explain
the
production
of
colours
or
sounds,
by
figure,
motion,
magnitude,
and
the
like,
must
needs
be
labour
in
vain.
And
accordingly
we
see
the
attempts
of
that
kind
are
not
at
all
satisfactory.
Which
may
be
said
in
general
of
those
instances
wherein
one
idea
or
quality
is
assigned
for
the
cause
of
another.
I
need
not
say
how
many
hypotheses
and
speculations
are
left
out,
and
how
much
the
study
of
nature
is
abridged
by
this
doctrine.
103.
The
great
mechanical
principle
now
in
vogue
is
attraction.
That
a
stone
falls
to
the
earth,
or
the
sea
swells
towards
the
moon,
may
to
some
appear
sufficiently
explained
thereby.
But
how
are
we
enlightened
by
being
told
this
is
done
by
attraction?
Is
it
that
that
word
signifies
the
manner
of
the
tendency,
and
that
it
is
by
the
mutual
drawing
of
bodies
instead
of
their
being
impelled
or
protruded
towards
each
other?
But,
nothing
is
determined
of
the
manner
or
action,
and
it
may
as
truly
(for
aught
we
know)
be
termed
"impulse,"
or
"protrusion,"
as
"attraction."
Again,
the
parts
of
steel
we
see
cohere
firmly
together,
and
this
also
is
accounted
for
by
attraction;
but,
in
this
as
in
the
other
instances,
I
do
not
perceive
that
anything
is
signified
besides
the
effect
itself;
for
as
to
the
manner
of
the
action
whereby
it
is
produced,
or
the
cause
which
produces
it,
these
are
not
so
much
as
aimed
at.
104.
Indeed,
if
we
take
a
view
of
the
several
phenomena,
and
compare
them
together,
we
may
observe
some
likeness
and
conformity
between
them.
For
example,
in
the
falling
of
a
stone
to
the
ground,
in
the
rising
of
the
sea
towards
the
moon,
in
cohesion,
crystallization,
etc,
there
is
something
alike,
namely,
an
union
or
mutual
approach
of
bodies.
So
that
any
one
of
these
or
the
like
phenomena
may
not
seem
strange
or
surprising
to
a
man
who
has
nicely
observed
and
compared
the
effects
of
nature.
For
that
only
is
thought
so
which
is
uncommon,
or
a
thing
by
itself,
and
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
our
observation.
That
bodies
should
tend
towards
the
centre
of
the
earth
is
not
thought
strange,
because
it
is
what
we
perceive
every
moment
of
our
lives.
But,
that
they
should
have
a
like
gravitation
towards
the
centre
of
the
moon
may
seem
odd
and
unaccountable
to
most
men,
because
it
is
discerned
only
in
the
tides.
But
a
philosopher,
whose
thoughts
take
in
a
larger
compass
of
nature,
having
observed
a
certain
similitude
of
appearances,
as
well
in
the
heavens
as
the
earth,
that
argue
innumerable
bodies
to
have
a
mutual
tendency
towards
each
other,
which
he
denotes
by
the
general
name
"attraction,"
whatever
can
be
reduced
to
that
he
thinks
justly
accounted
for.
Thus
he
explains
the
tides
by
the
attraction
of
the
terraqueous
globe
towards
the
moon,
which
to
him
does
not
appear
odd
or
anomalous,
but
only
a
particular
example
of
a
general
rule
or
law
of
nature.
105.
If
therefore
we
consider
the
difference
there
is
betwixt
natural
philosophers
and
other
men,
with
regard
to
their
knowledge
of
the
phenomena,
we
shall
find
it
consists
not
in
an
exacter
knowledge
of
the
efficient
cause
that
produces
them-
for
that
can
be
no
other
than
the
will
of
a
spirit-
but
only
in
a
greater
largeness
of
comprehension,
whereby
analogies,
harmonies,
and
agreements
are
discovered
in
the
works
of
nature,
and
the
particular
effects
explained,
that
is,
reduced
to
general
rules,
see
sect.
62,
which
rules,
grounded
on
the
analogy
and
uniformness
observed
in
the
production
of
natural
effects,
are
most
agreeable
and
sought
after
by
the
mind;
for
that
they
extend
our
prospect
beyond
what
is
present
and
near
to
us,
and
enable
us
to
make
very
probable
conjectures
touching
things
that
may
have
happened
at
very
great
distances
of
time
and
place,
as
well
as
to
predict
things
to
come;
which
sort
of
endeavour
towards
omniscience
is
much
affected
by
the
mind.
106.
But
we
should
proceed
warily
in
such
things,
for
we
are
apt
to
lay
too
great
stress
on
analogies,
and,
to
the
prejudice
of
truth,
humour
that
eagerness
of
the
mind
whereby
it
is
carried
to
extend
its
knowledge
into
general
theorems.
For
example,
in
the
business
of
gravitation
or
mutual
attraction,
because
it
appears
in
many
instances,
some
are
straightway
for
pronouncing
it
universal;
and
that
to
attract
and
be
attracted
by
every
other
body
is
an
essential
quality
inherent
in
all
bodies
whatsoever.
Whereas
it
is
evident
the
fixed
stars
have
no
such
tendency
towards
each
other;
and,
so
far
is
that
gravitation
from
being
essential
to
bodies
that
in
some
instances
a
quite
contrary
principle
seems
to
shew
itself;
as
in
the
perpendicular
growth
of
plants,
and
the
elasticity
of
the
air.
There
is
nothing
necessary
or
essential
in
the
case,
but
it
depends
entirely
on
the
will
of
the
Governing
Spirit,
who
causes
certain
bodies
to
cleave
together
or
tend
towards
each
other
according
to
various
laws,
whilst
He
keeps
others
at
a
fixed
distance;
and
to
some
He
gives
a
quite
contrary
tendency
to
fly
asunder
just
as
He
sees
convenient.
107.
After
what
has
been
premised,
I
think
we
may
lay
down
the
following
conclusions.
First,
it
is
plain
philosophers
amuse
themselves
in
vain,
when
they
inquire
for
any
natural
efficient
cause,
distinct
from
a
mind
or
spirit.
Secondly,
considering
the
whole
creation
is
the
workmanship
of
a
wise
and
good
Agent,
it
should
seem
to
become
philosophers
to
employ
their
thoughts
(contrary
to
what
some
hold)
about
the
final
causes
of
things;
and
I
confess
I
see
no
reason
why
pointing
out
the
various
ends
to
which
natural
things
are
adapted,
and
for
which
they
were
originally
with
unspeakable
wisdom
contrived,
should
not
be
thought
one
good
way
of
accounting
for
them,
and
altogether
worthy
a
philosopher.
Thirdly,
from
what
has
been
premised
no
reason
can
be
drawn
why
the
history
of
nature
should
not
still
be
studied,
and
observations
and
experiments
made,
which,
that
they
are
of
use
to
mankind,
and
enable
us
to
draw
any
general
conclusions,
is
not
the
result
of
any
immutable
habitudes
or
relations
between
things
themselves,
but
only
of
God's
goodness
and
kindness
to
men
in
the
administration
of
the
world.
See
sect.
30
and
31
Fourthly,
by
a
diligent
observation
of
the
phenomena
within
our
view,
we
may
discover
the
general
laws
of
nature,
and
from
them
deduce
the
other
phenomena;
I
do
not
say
demonstrate,
for
all
deductions
of
that
kind
depend
on
a
supposition
that
the
Author
of
nature
always
operates
uniformly,
and
in
a
constant
observance
of
those
rules
we
take
for
principles:
which
we
cannot
evidently
know.
108.
Those
men
who
frame
general
rules
from
the
phenomena
and
afterwards
derive
the
phenomena
from
those
rules,
seem
to
consider
signs
rather
than
causes.
A
man
may
well
understand
natural
signs
without
knowing
their
analogy,
or
being
able
to
say
by
what
rule
a
thing
is
so
or
so.
And,
as
it
is
very
possible
to
write
improperly,
through
too
strict
an
observance
of
general
grammar
rules;
so,
in
arguing
from
general
laws
of
nature,
it
is
not
impossible
we
may
extend
the
analogy
too
far,
and
by
that
means
run
into
mistakes.
109.
As
in
reading
other
books
a
wise
man
will
choose
to
fix
his
thoughts
on
the
sense
and
apply
it
to
use,
rather
than
lay
them
out
in
grammatical
remarks
on
the
language;
so,
in
perusing
the
volume
of
nature,
it
seems
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
mind
to
affect
an
exactness
in
reducing
each
particular
phenomenon
to
general
rules,
or
shewing
how
it
follows
from
them.
We
should
propose
to
ourselves
nobler
views,
namely,
to
recreate
and
exalt
the
mind
with
a
prospect
of
the
beauty,
order.
extent,
and
variety
of
natural
things:
hence,
by
proper
inferences,
to
enlarge
our
notions
of
the
grandeur,
wisdom,
and
beneficence
of
the
Creator;
and
lastly,
to
make
the
several
parts
of
the
creation,
so
far
as
in
us
lies,
subservient
to
the
ends
they
were
designed
for,
God's
glory,
and
the
sustentation
and
comfort
of
ourselves
and
fellow-creatures.
110.
The
best
key
for
the
aforesaid
analogy
or
natural
Science
will
be
easily
acknowledged
to
be
a
certain
celebrated
Treatise
of
Mechanics.
In
the
entrance
of
which
justly
admired
treatise,
Time,
Space,
and
Motion
are
distinguished
into
absolute
and
relative,
true
and
apparent,
mathematical
and
vulgar;
which
distinction,
as
it
is
at
large
explained
by
the
author,
does
suppose
these
quantities
to
have
an
existence
without
the
mind;
and
that
they
are
ordinarily
conceived
with
relation
to
sensible
things,
to
which
nevertheless
in
their
own
nature
they
bear
no
relation
at
all.
111.
As
for
Time,
as
it
is
there
taken
in
an
absolute
or
abstracted
sense,
for
the
duration
or
perseverance
of
the
existence
of
things,
I
have
nothing
more
to
add
concerning
it
after
what
has
been
already
said
on
that
subject.
Sect.
97
and
98.
For
the
rest,
this
celebrated
author
holds
there
is
an
absolute
Space,
which,
being
unperceivable
to
sense,
remains
in
itself
similar
and
immovable;
and
relative
space
to
be
the
measure
thereof,
which,
being
movable
and
defined
by
its
situation
in
respect
of
sensible
bodies,
is
vulgarly
taken
for
immovable
space.
Place
he
defines
to
be
that
part
of
space
which
is
occupied
by
any
body;
and
according
as
the
space
is
absolute
or
relative
so
also
is
the
place.
Absolute
Motion
is
said
to
be
the
translation
of
a
body
from
absolute
place
to
absolute
place,
as
relative
motion
is
from
one
relative
place
to
another.
And,
because
the
parts
of
absolute
space
do
not
fall
under
our
senses,
instead
of
them
we
are
obliged
to
use
their
sensible
measures,
and
so
define
both
place
and
motion
with
respect
to
bodies
which
we
regard
as
immovable.
But,
it
is
said
in
philosophical
matters
we
must
abstract
from
our
senses,
since
it
may
be
that
none
of
those
bodies
which
seem
to
be
quiescent
are
truly
so,
and
the
same
thing
which
is
moved
relatively
may
be
really
at
rest;
as
likewise
one
and
the
same
body
may
be
in
relative
rest
and
motion,
or
even
moved
with
contrary
relative
motions
at
the
same
time,
according
as
its
place
is
variously
defined.
All
which
ambiguity
is
to
be
found
in
the
apparent
motions,
but
not
at
all
in
the
true
or
absolute,
which
should
therefore
be
alone
regarded
in
philosophy.
And
the
true
as
we
are
told
are
distinguished
from
apparent
or
relative
motions
by
the
following
properties.-
First,
in
true
or
absolute
motion
all
parts
which
preserve
the
same
position
with
respect
of
the
whole,
partake
of
the
motions
of
the
whole.
Secondly,
the
place
being
moved,
that
which
is
placed
therein
is
also
moved;
so
that
a
body
moving
in
a
place
which
is
in
motion
doth
participate
the
motion
of
its
place.
Thirdly,
true
motion
is
never
generated
or
changed
otherwise
than
by
force
impressed
on
the
body
itself.
Fourthly,
true
motion
is
always
changed
by
force
impressed
on
the
body
moved.
Fifthly,
in
circular
motion
barely
relative
there
is
no
centrifugal
force,
which,
nevertheless,
in
that
which
is
true
or
absolute,
is
proportional
to
the
quantity
of
motion.
112.
But,
notwithstanding
what
has
been
said,
I
must
confess
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
there
can
be
any
motion
other
than
relative;
so
that
to
conceive
motion
there
must
be
at
least
conceived
two
bodies,
whereof
the
distance
or
position
in
regard
to
each
other
is
varied.
Hence,
if
there
was
one
only
body
in
being
it
could
not
possibly
be
moved.
This
seems
evident,
in
that
the
idea
I
have
of
motion
doth
necessarily
include
relation.
113.
But,
though
in
every
motion
it
be
necessary
to
conceive
more
bodies
than
one,
yet
it
may
be
that
one
only
is
moved,
namely,
that
on
which
the
force
causing
the
change
in
the
distance
or
situation
of
the
bodies,
is
impressed.
For,
however
some
may
define
relative
motion,
so
as
to
term
that
body
moved
which
changes
its
distance
from
some
other
body,
whether
the
force
or
action
causing
that
change
were
impressed
on
it
or
no,
yet
as
relative
motion
is
that
which
is
perceived
by
sense,
and
regarded
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life,
it
should
seem
that
every
man
of
common
sense
knows
what
it
is
as
well
as
the
best
philosopher.
Now,
I
ask
any
one
whether,
in
his
sense
of
motion
as
he
walks
along
the
streets,
the
stones
he
passes
over
may
be
said
to
move,
because
they
change
distance
with
his
feet?
To
me
it
appears
that
though
motion
includes
a
relation
of
one
thing
to
another,
yet
it
is
not
necessary
that
each
term
of
the
relation
be
denominated
from
it.
As
a
man
may
think
of
somewhat
which
does
not
think,
so
a
body
may
be
moved
to
or
from
another
body
which
is
not
therefore
itself
in
motion.
114.
As
the
place
happens
to
be
variously
defined,
the
motion
which
is
related
to
it
varies.
A
man
in
a
ship
may
be
said
to
be
quiescent
with
relation
to
the
sides
of
the
vessel,
and
yet
move
with
relation
to
the
land.
Or
he
may
move
eastward
in
respect
of
the
one,
and
westward
in
respect
of
the
other.
In
the
common
affairs
of
life
men
never
go
beyond
the
earth
to
define
the
place
of
any
body;
and
what
is
quiescent
in
respect
of
that
is
accounted
absolutely
to
be
so.
But
philosophers,
who
have
a
greater
extent
of
thought,
and
juster
notions
of
the
system
of
things,
discover
even
the
earth
itself
to
be
moved.
In
order
therefore
to
fix
their
notions
they
seem
to
conceive
the
corporeal
world
as
finite,
and
the
utmost
unmoved
walls
or
shell
thereof
to
be
the
place
whereby
they
estimate
true
motions.
If
we
sound
our
own
conceptions,
I
believe
we
may
find
all
the
absolute
motion
we
can
frame
an
idea
of
to
be
at
bottom
no
other
than
relative
motion
thus
defined.
For,
as
hath
been
already
observed,
absolute
motion,
exclusive
of
all
external
relation,
is
incomprehensible;
and
to
this
kind
of
relative
motion
all
the
above-mentioned
properties,
causes,
and
effects
ascribed
to
absolute
motion
will,
if
I
mistake
not,
be
found
to
agree.
As
to
what
is
said
of
the
centrifugal
force,
that
it
does
not
at
all
belong
to
circular
relative
motion,
I
do
not
see
how
this
follows
from
the
experiment
which
is
brought
to
prove
it.
See
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica,
in
Schol.
Def.
VIII.
For
the
water
in
the
vessel
at
that
time
wherein
it
is
said
to
have
the
greatest
relative
circular
motion,
hath,
I
think,
no
motion
at
all;
as
is
plain
from
the
foregoing
section.
115.
For,
to
denominate
a
body
moved
it
is
requisite,
first,
that
it
change
its
distance
or
situation
with
regard
to
some
other
body;
and
secondly,
that
the
force
occasioning
that
change
be
applied
to
it.
If
either
of
these
be
wanting,
I
do
not
think
that,
agreeably
to
the
sense
of
mankind,
or
the
propriety
of
language,
a
body
can
be
said
to
be
in
motion.
I
grant
indeed
that
it
is
possible
for
us
to
think
a
body
which
we
see
change
its
distance
from
some
other
to
be
moved,
though
it
have
no
force
applied
to
it
(in
which
sense
there
may
be
apparent
motion),
but
then
it
is
because
the
force
causing
the
change
of
distance
is
imagined
by
us
to
be
applied
or
impressed
on
that
body
thought
to
move;
which
indeed
shews
we
are
capable
of
mistaking
a
thing
to
be
in
motion
which
is
not,
and
that
is
all.
116.
From
what
has
been
said
it
follows
that
the
philosophic
consideration
of
motion
does
not
imply
the
being
of
an
absolute
Space,
distinct
from
that
which
is
perceived
by
sense
and
related
bodies;
which
that
it
cannot
exist
without
the
mind
is
clear
upon
the
same
principles
that
demonstrate
the
like
of
all
other
objects
of
sense.
And
perhaps,
if
we
inquire
narrowly,
we
shall
find
we
cannot
even
frame
an
idea
of
pure
Space
exclusive
of
all
body.
This
I
must
confess
seems
impossible,
as
being
a
most
abstract
idea.
When
I
excite
a
motion
in
some
part
of
my
body,
if
it
be
free
or
without
resistance,
I
say
there
is
Space;
but
if
I
find
a
resistance,
then
I
say
there
is
Body;
and
in
proportion
as
the
resistance
to
motion
is
lesser
or
greater,
I
say
the
space
is
more
or
less
pure.
So
that
when
I
speak
of
pure
or
empty
space,
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
word
"space"
stands
for
an
idea
distinct
from
or
conceivable
without
body
and
motion-
though
indeed
we
are
apt
to
think
every
noun
substantive
stands
for
a
distinct
idea
that
may
be
separated
from
all
others;
which
has
occasioned
infinite
mistakes.
When,
therefore,
supposing
all
the
world
to
be
annihilated
besides
my
own
body,
I
say
there
still
remains
pure
Space,
thereby
nothing
else
is
meant
but
only
that
I
conceive
it
possible
for
the
limbs
of
my
body
to
be
moved
on
all
sides
without
the
least
resistance,
but
if
that,
too,
were
annihilated
then
there
could
be
no
motion,
and
consequently
no
Space.
Some,
perhaps,
may
think
the
sense
of
seeing
doth
furnish
them
with
the
idea
of
pure
space;
but
it
is
plain
from
what
we
have
elsewhere
shewn,
that
the
ideas
of
space
and
distance
are
not
obtained
by
that
sense.
See
the
Essay
concerning
Vision.

What
is
here
laid
down
seems
to
put
an
end
to
all
those
disputes
and
difficulties
that
have
sprung
up
amongst
the
learned
concerning
the
nature
of
pure
Space.
But
the
chief
advantage
arising
from
it
is
that
we
are
freed
from
that
dangerous
dilemma,
to
which
several
who
have
employed
their
thoughts
on
that
subject
imagine
themselves
reduced,
to
wit,
of
thinking
either
that
Real
Space
is
God,
or
else
that
there
is
something
beside
God
which
is
eternal,
uncreated,
infinite,
indivisible,
immutable.
Both
which
may
justly
be
thought
pernicious
and
absurd
notions.
It
is
certain
that
not
a
few
divines,
as
well
as
philosophers
of
great
note,
have,
from
the
difficulty
they
found
in
conceiving
either
limits
or
annihilation
of
space,
concluded
it
must
be
divine.
And
some
of
late
have
set
themselves
particularly
to
shew
the
incommunicable
attributes
of
God
agree
to
it.
Which
doctrine,
how
unworthy
soever
it
may
seem
of
the
Divine
Nature,
yet
I
do
not
see
how
we
can
get
clear
of
it,
so
long
as
we
adhere
to
the
received
opinions.
118.
Hitherto
of
Natural
Philosophy:
we
come
now
to
make
some
inquiry
concerning
that
other
great
branch
of
speculative
knowledge,
to
wit,
Mathematics.
These,
how
celebrated
soever
they
may
be
for
their
clearness
and
certainty
of
demonstration,
which
is
hardly
anywhere
else
to
be
found,
cannot
nevertheless
be
supposed
altogether
free
from
mistakes,
if
in
their
principles
there
lurks
some
secret
error
which
is
common
to
the
professors
of
those
sciences
with
the
rest
of
mankind.
Mathematicians,
though
they
deduce
their
theorems
from
a
great
height
of
evidence,
yet
their
first
principles
are
limited
by
the
consideration
of
quantity:
and
they
do
not
ascend
into
any
inquiry
concerning
those
transcendental
maxims
which
influence
all
the
particular
sciences,
each
part
whereof,
Mathematics
not
excepted,
does
consequently
participate
of
the
errors
involved
in
them.
That
the
principles
laid
down
by
mathematicians
are
true,
and
their
way
of
deduction
from
those
principles
clear
and
incontestible,
we
do
not
deny;
but,
we
hold
there
may
be
certain
erroneous
maxims
of
greater
extent
than
the
object
of
Mathematics,
and
for
that
reason
not
expressly
mentioned,
though
tacitly
supposed
throughout
the
whole
progress
of
that
science;
and
that
the
ill
effects
of
those
secret
unexamined
errors
are
diffused
through
all
the
branches
thereof.
To
be
plain,
we
suspect
the
mathematicians
are
as
well
as
other
men
concerned
in
the
errors
arising
from
the
doctrine
of
abstract
general
ideas,
and
the
existence
of
objects
without
the
mind.
119.
Arithmetic
has
been
thought
to
have
for
its
object
abstract
ideas
of
Number;
of
which
to
understand
the
properties
and
mutual
habitudes,
is
supposed
no
mean
part
of
speculative
knowledge.
The
opinion
of
the
pure
and
intellectual
nature
of
numbers
in
abstract
has
made
them
in
esteem
with
those
philosophers
who
seem
to
have
affected
an
uncommon
fineness
and
elevation
of
thought.
It
hath
set
a
price
on
the
most
trifling
numerical
speculations
which
in
practice
are
of
no
use,
but
serve
only
for
amusement;
and
hath
therefore
so
far
infected
the
minds
of
some,
that
they
have
dreamed
of
mighty
mysteries
involved
in
numbers,
and
attempted
the
explication
of
natural
things
by
them.
But,
if
we
inquire
into
our
own
thoughts,
and
consider
what
has
been
premised,
we
may
perhaps
entertain
a
low
opinion
of
those
high
flights
and
abstractions,
and
look
on
all
inquiries,
about
numbers
only
as
so
many
difficiles
nugae,
so
far
as
they
are
not
subservient
to
practice,
and
promote
the
benefit
of
life.
120.
Unity
in
abstract
we
have
before
considered
in
sect.
13,
from
which
and
what
has
been
said
in
the
Introduction,
it
plainly
follows
there
is
not
any
such
idea.
But,
number
being
defined
a
"collection
of
units,"
we
may
conclude
that,
if
there
be
no
such
thing
as
unity
or
unit
in
abstract,
there
are
no
ideas
of
number
in
abstract
denoted
by
the
numeral
names
and
figures.
The
theories
therefore
in
Arithmetic.
if
they
are
abstracted
from
the
names
and
figures,
as
likewise
from
all
use
and
practice,
as
well
as
from
the
particular
things
numbered,
can
be
supposed
to
have
nothing
at
all
for
their
object;
hence
we
may
see
how
entirely
the
science
of
numbers
is
subordinate
to
practice,
and
how
jejune
and
trifling
it
becomes
when
considered
as
a
matter
of
mere
speculation.
121.
However,
since
there
may
be
some
who,
deluded
by
the
specious
show
of
discovering
abstracted
verities,
waste
their
time
in
arithmetical
theorems
and
problems
which
have
not
any
use,
it
will
not
be
amiss
if
we
more
fully
consider
and
expose
the
vanity
of
that
pretence;
and
this
will
plainly
appear
by
taking
a
view
of
Arithmetic
in
its
infancy,
and
observing
what
it
was
that
originally
put
men
on
the
study
of
that
science,
and
to
what
scope
they
directed
it.
It
is
natural
to
think
that
at
first,
men,
for
ease
of
memory
and
help
of
computation,
made
use
of
counters,
or
in
writing
of
single
strokes,
points,
or
the
like,
each
whereof
was
made
to
signify
an
unit,
i.e.,
some
one
thing
of
whatever
kind
they
had
occasion
to
reckon.
Afterwards
they
found
out
the
more
compendious
ways
of
making
one
character
stand
in
place
of
several
strokes
or
points.
And,
lastly,
the
notation
of
the
Arabians
or
Indians
came
into
use,
wherein,
by
the
repetition
of
a
few
characters
or
figures,
and
varying
the
signification
of
each
figure
according
to
the
place
it
obtains,
all
numbers
may
be
most
aptly
expressed;
which
seems
to
have
been
done
in
imitation
of
language,
so
that
an
exact
analogy
is
observed
betwixt
the
notation
by
figures
and
names,
the
nine
simple
figures
answering
the
nine
first
numeral
names
and
places
in
the
former,
corresponding
to
denominations
in
the
latter.
And
agreeably
to
those
conditions
of
the
simple
and
local
value
of
figures,
were
contrived
methods
of
finding,
from
the
given
figures
or
marks
of
the
parts,
what
figures
and
how
placed
are
proper
to
denote
the
whole,
or
vice
versa.
And
having
found
the
sought
figures,
the
same
rule
or
analogy
being
observed
throughout,
it
is
easy
to
read
them
into
words;
and
so
the
number
becomes
perfectly
known.
For
then
the
number
of
any
particular
things
is
said
to
be
known,
when
we
know
the
name
of
figures
(with
their
due
arrangement)
that
according
to
the
standing
analogy
belong
to
them.
For,
these
signs
being
known,
we
can
by
the
operations
of
arithmetic
know
the
signs
of
any
part
of
the
particular
sums
signified
by
them;
and,
thus
computing
in
signs
(because
of
the
connexion
established
betwixt
them
and
the
distinct
multitudes
of
things
whereof
one
is
taken
for
an
unit),
we
may
be
able
rightly
to
sum
up,
divide,
and
proportion
the
things
themselves
that
we
intend
to
number.
122.
In
Arithmetic,
therefore,
we
regard
not
the
things,
but
the
signs,
which
nevertheless
are
not
regarded
for
their
own
sake,
but
because
they
direct
us
how
to
act
with
relation
to
things,
and
dispose
rightly
of
them.
Now,
agreeably
to
what
we
have
before
observed
of
words
in
general
(sect.
19,
Introd.)
it
happens
here
likewise
that
abstract
ideas
are
thought
to
be
signified
by
numeral
names
or
characters,
while
they
do
not
suggest
ideas
of
particular
things
to
our
minds.
I
shall
not
at
present
enter
into
a
more
particular
dissertation
on
this
subject,
but
only
observe
that
it
is
evident
from
what
has
been
said,
those
things
which
pass
for
abstract
truths
and
theorems
concerning
numbers,
are
in
reality
conversant
about
no
object
distinct
from
particular
numeral
things,
except
only
names
and
characters,
which
originally
came
to
be
considered
on
no
other
account
but
their
being
signs,
or
capable
to
represent
aptly
whatever
particular
things
men
had
need
to
compute.
Whence
it
follows
that
to
study
them
for
their
own
sake
would
be
just
as
wise,
and
to
as
good
purpose
as
if
a
man,
neglecting
the
true
use
or
original
intention
and
subserviency
of
language,
should
spend
his
time
in
impertinent
criticisms
upon
words,
or
reasonings
and
controversies
purely
verbal.
123.
From
numbers
we
proceed
to
speak
of
Extension,
which,
considered
as
relative,
is
the
object
of
Geometry.
The
infinite
divisibility
of
finite
extension,
though
it
is
not
expressly
laid
down
either
as
an
axiom
or
theorem
in
the
elements
of
that
science,
yet
is
throughout
the
same
everywhere
supposed
and
thought
to
have
so
inseparable
and
essential
a
connexion
with
the
principles
and
demonstrations
in
Geometry,
that
mathematicians
never
admit
it
into
doubt,
or
make
the
least
question
of
it.
And,
as
this
notion
is
the
source
from
whence
do
spring
all
those
amusing
geometrical
paradoxes
which
have
such
a
direct
repugnancy
to
the
plain
common
sense
of
mankind,
and
are
admitted
with
so
much
reluctance
into
a
mind
not
yet
debauched
by
learning;
so
it
is
the
principal
occasion
of
all
that
nice
and
extreme
subtilty
which
renders
the
study
of
Mathematics
so
difficult
and
tedious.
Hence,
if
we
can
make
it
appear
that
no
finite
extension
contains
innumerable
parts,
or
is
infinitely
divisible,
it
follows
that
we
shall
at
once
clear
the
science
of
Geometry
from
a
great
number
of
difficulties
and
contradictions
which
have
ever
been
esteemed
a
reproach
to
human
reason,
and
withal
make
the
attainment
thereof
a
business
of
much
less
time
and
pains
than
it
hitherto
has
been.
124.
Every
particular
finite
extension
which
may
possibly
be
the
object
of
our
thought
is
an
idea
existing
only
in
the
mind,
and
consequently
each
part
thereof
must
be
perceived.
If,
therefore,
I
cannot
perceive
innumerable
parts
in
any
finite
extension
that
I
consider,
it
is
certain
they
are
not
contained
in
it;
but,
it
is
evident
that
I
cannot
distinguish
innumerable
parts
in
any
particular
line,
surface,
or
solid,
which
I
either
perceive
by
sense,
or
figure
to
myself
in
my
mind:
wherefore
I
conclude
they
are
not
contained
in
it.
Nothing
can
be
plainer
to
me
than
that
the
extensions
I
have
in
view
are
no
other
than
my
own
ideas;
and
it
is
no
less
plain
that
I
cannot
resolve
any
one
of
my
ideas
into
an
infinite
number
of
other
ideas,
that
is,
that
they
are
not
infinitely
divisible.
If
by
finite
extension
be
meant
something
distinct
from
a
finite
idea,
I
declare
I
do
not
know
what
that
is,
and
so
cannot
affirm
or
deny
anything
of
it.
But
if
the
terms
"extension,"
"parts,"
&c.,
are
taken
in
any
sense
conceivable,
that
is,
for
ideas,
then
to
say
a
finite
quantity
or
extension
consists
of
parts
infinite
in
number
is
so
manifest
a
contradiction,
that
every
one
at
first
sight
acknowledges
it
to
be
so;
and
it
is
impossible
it
should
ever
gain
the
assent
of
any
reasonable
creature
who
is
not
brought
to
it
by
gentle
and
slow
degrees,
as
a
converted
Gentile
to
the
belief
of
transubstantiation.
Ancient
and
rooted
prejudices
do
often
pass
into
principles;
and
those
propositions
which
once
obtain
the
force
and
credit
of
a
principle,
are
not
only
themselves,
but
likewise
whatever
is
deducible
from
them,
thought
privileged
from
all
examination.
And
there
is
no
absurdity
so
gross,
which,
by
this
means,
the
mind
of
man
may
not
be
prepared
to
swallow.
125.
He
whose
understanding
is
possessed
with
the
doctrine
of
abstract
general
ideas
may
be
persuaded
that
(whatever
be
thought
of
the
ideas
of
sense)
extension
in
abstract
is
infinitely
divisible.
And
one
who
thinks
the
objects
of
sense
exist
without
the
mind
will
perhaps
in
virtue
thereof
be
brought
to
admit
that
a
line
but
an
inch
long
may
contain
innumerable
parts-
really
existing,
though
too
small
to
be
discerned.
These
errors
are
grafted
as
well
in
the
minds
of
geometricians
as
of
other
men,
and
have
a
like
influence
on
their
reasonings;
and
it
were
no
difficult
thing
to
shew
how
the
arguments
from
Geometry
made
use
of
to
support
the
infinite
divisibility
of
extension
are
bottomed
on
them.
At
present
we
shall
only
observe
in
general
whence
it
is
the
mathematicians
are
all
so
fond
and
tenacious
of
that
doctrine.
126.
It
hath
been
observed
in
another
place
that
the
theorems
and
demonstrations
in
Geometry
are
conversant
about
universal
ideas
(sect.
15,
Introd.);
where
it
is
explained
in
what
sense
this
ought
to
be
understood,
to
wit,
the
particular
lines
and
figures
included
in
the
diagram
are
supposed
to
stand
for
innumerable
others
of
different
sizes;
or,
in
other
words,
the
geometer
considers
them
abstracting
from
their
magnitude-
which
does
not
imply
that
he
forms
an
abstract
idea,
but
only
that
he
cares
not
what
the
particular
magnitude
is,
whether
great
or
small,
but
looks
on
that
as
a
thing
different
to
the
demonstration.
Hence
it
follows
that
a
line
in
the
scheme
but
an
inch
long
must
be
spoken
of
as
though
it
contained
ten
thousand
parts,
since
it
is
regarded
not
in
itself,
but
as
it
is
universal;
and
it
is
universal
only
in
its
signification,
whereby
it
represents
innumerable
lines
greater
than
itself,
in
which
may
be
distinguished
ten
thousand
parts
or
more,
though
there
may
not
be
above
an
inch
in
it.
After
this
manner,
the
properties
of
the
lines
signified
are
(by
a
very
usual
figure)
transferred
to
the
sign,
and
thence,
through
mistake,
though
to
appertain
to
it
considered
in
its
own
nature.
127.
Because
there
is
no
number
of
parts
so
great
but
it
is
possible
there
may
be
a
line
containing
more,
the
inch-line
is
said
to
contain
parts
more
than
any
assignable
number;
which
is
true,
not
of
the
inch
taken
absolutely,
but
only
for
the
things
signified
by
it.
But
men,
not
retaining
that
distinction
in
their
thoughts,
slide
into
a
belief
that
the
small
particular
line
described
on
paper
contains
in
itself
parts
innumerable.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
the
ten-thousandth
part
of
an
inch;
but
there
is
of
a
mile
or
diameter
of
the
earth,
which
may
be
signified
by
that
inch.
When
therefore
I
delineate
a
triangle
on
paper,
and
take
one
side
not
above
an
inch,
for
example,
in
length
to
be
the
radius,
this
I
consider
as
divided
into
10,000
or
100,000
parts
or
more;
for,
though
the
ten-thousandth
part
of
that
line
considered
in
itself
is
nothing
at
all,
and
consequently
may
be
neglected
without
an
error
or
inconveniency,
yet
these
described
lines,
being
only
marks
standing
for
greater
quantities,
whereof
it
may
be
the
ten-thousandth
part
is
very
considerable,
it
follows
that,
to
prevent
notable
errors
in
practice,
the
radius
must
be
taken
of
10,000
parts
or
more.
128.
From
what
has
been
said
the
reason
is
plain
why,
to
the
end
any
theorem
become
universal
in
its
use,
it
is
necessary
we
speak
of
the
lines
described
on
paper
as
though
they
contained
parts
which
really
they
do
not.
In
doing
of
which,
if
we
examine
the
matter
thoroughly,
we
shall
perhaps
discover
that
we
cannot
conceive
an
inch
itself
as
consisting
of,
or
being
divisible
into,
a
thousand
parts,
but
only
some
other
line
which
is
far
greater
than
an
inch,
and
represented
by
it;
and
that
when
we
say
a
line
is
infinitely
divisible,
we
must
mean
a
line
which
is
infinitely
great.
What
we
have
here
observed
seems
to
be
the
chief
cause
why,
to
suppose
the
infinite
divisibility
of
finite
extension
has
been
thought
necessary
in
geometry.
129.
The
several
absurdities
and
contradictions
which
flowed
from
this
false
principle
might,
one
would
think,
have
been
esteemed
so
many
demonstrations
against
it.
But,
by
I
know
not
what
logic,
it
is
held
that
proofs
a
posteriori
are
not
to
be
admitted
against
propositions
relating
to
infinity,
as
though
it
were
not
impossible
even
for
an
infinite
mind
to
reconcile
contradictions;
or
as
if
anything
absurd
and
repugnant
could
have
a
necessary
connexion
with
truth
or
flow
from
it.
But,
whoever
considers
the
weakness
of
this
pretence
will
think
it
was
contrived
on
purpose
to
humour
the
laziness
of
the
mind
which
had
rather
acquiesce
in
an
indolent
scepticism
than
be
at
the
pains
to
go
through
with
a
severe
examination
of
those
principles
it
has
ever
embraced
for
true.
130.
Of
late
the
speculations
about
Infinities
have
run
so
high,
and
grown
to
such
strange
notions,
as
have
occasioned
no
small
scruples
and
disputes
among
the
geometers
of
the
present
age.
Some
there
are
of
great
note
who,
not
content
with
holding
that
finite
lines
may
be
divided
into
an
infinite
number
of
parts,
do
yet
farther
maintain
that
each
of
those
infinitesimals
is
itself
subdivisible
into
an
infinity
of
other
parts
or
infinitesimals
of
a
second
order,
and
so
on
ad
infinitum.
These,
I
say,
assert
there
are
infinitesimals
of
infinitesimals
of
infinitesimals,
&c.,
without
ever
coming
to
an
end;
so
that
according
to
them
an
inch
does
not
barely
contain
an
infinite
number
of
parts,
but
an
infinity
of
an
infinity
of
an
infinity
ad
infinitum
of
parts.
Others
there
be
who
hold
all
orders
of
infinitesimals
below
the
first
to
be
nothing
at
all;
thinking
it
with
good
reason
absurd
to
imagine
there
is
any
positive
quantity
or
part
of
extension
which,
though
multiplied
infinitely,
can
never
equal
the
smallest
given
extension.
And
yet
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
no
less
absurd
to
think
the
square,
cube
or
other
power
of
a
positive
real
root,
should
itself
be
nothing
at
all;
which
they
who
hold
infinitesimals
of
the
first
order,
denying
all
of
the
subsequent
orders,
are
obliged
to
maintain.
131.
Have
we
not
therefore
reason
to
conclude
they
are
both
in
the
wrong,
and
that
there
is
in
effect
no
such
thing
as
parts
infinitely
small,
or
an
infinite
number
of
parts
contained
in
any
finite
quantity?
But
you
will
say
that
if
this
doctrine
obtains
it
will
follow
the
very
foundations
of
Geometry
are
destroyed,
and
those
great
men
who
have
raised
that
science
to
so
astonishing
a
height,
have
been
all
the
while
building
a
castle
in
the
air.
To
this
it
may
be
replied
that
whatever
is
useful
in
geometry,
and
promotes
the
benefit
of
human
life,
does
still
remain
firm
and
unshaken
on
our
principles;
that
science
considered
as
practical
will
rather
receive
advantage
than
any
prejudice
from
what
has
been
said.
But
to
set
this
in
a
due
light
may
be
the
proper
business
of
another
place.
For
the
rest,
though
it
should
follow
that
some
of
the
more
intricate
and
subtle
parts
of
Speculative
Mathematics
may
be
pared
off
without
any
prejudice
to
truth,
yet
I
do
not
see
what
damage
will
be
thence
derived
to
mankind.
On
the
contrary,
I
think
it
were
highly
to
be
wished
that
men
of
great
abilities
and
obstinate
application
would
draw
off
their
thoughts
from
those
amusements,
and
employ
them
in
the
study
of
such
things
as
lie
nearer
the
concerns
of
life,
or
have
a
more
direct
influence
on
the
manners.
132.
It
is
be
said
that
several
theorems
undoubtedly
true
are
discovered
by
methods
in
which
infinitesimals
are
made
use
of,
which
could
never
have
been
if
their
existence
included
a
contradiction
in
it;
I
answer
that
upon
a
thorough
examination
it
will
not
be
found
that
in
any
instance
it
is
necessary
to
make
use
of
or
conceive
infinitesimal
parts
of
finite
lines,
or
even
quantities
less
than
the
minimum
sensible;
nay,
it
will
be
evident
this
is
never
done,
it
being
impossible.
133.
By
what
we
have
premised,
it
is
plain
that
very
numerous
and
important
errors
have
taken
their
rise
from
those
false
Principles
which
were
impugned
in
the
foregoing
parts
of
this
treatise;
and
the
opposites
of
those
erroneous
tenets
at
the
same
time
appear
to
be
most
fruitful
Principles,
from
whence
do
flow
innumerable
consequences
highly
advantageous
to
true
philosophy.
as
well
as
to
religion.
Particularly
Matter,
or
the
absolute
existence
of
corporeal
objects,
hath
been
shewn
to
be
that
wherein
the
most
avowed
and
pernicious
enemies
of
all
knowledge,
whether
human
or
divine,
have
ever
placed
their
chief
strength
and
confidence.
And
surely,
if
by
distinguishing
the
real
existence
of
unthinking
things
from
their
being
perceived,
and
allowing
them
a
subsistance
of
their
own
out
of
the
minds
of
spirits,
no
one
thing
is
explained
in
nature,
but
on
the
contrary
a
great
many
inexplicable
difficulties
arise;
if
the
supposition
of
Matter
is
barely
precarious,
as
not
being
grounded
on
so
much
as
one
single
reason;
if
its
consequences
cannot
endure
the
light
of
examination
and
free
inquiry,
but
screen
themselves
under
the
dark
and
general
pretence
of
"infinites
being
incomprehensible";
if
withal
the
removal
of
this
Matter
be
not
attended
with
the
least
evil
consequence;
if
it
be
not
even
missed
in
the
world,
but
everything
as
well,
nay
much
easier
conceived
without
it;
if,
lastly,
both
Sceptics
and
Atheists
are
for
ever
silenced
upon
supposing
only
spirits
and
ideas,
and
this
scheme
of
things
is
perfectly
agreeable
both
to
Reason
and
Religion:
methinks
we
may
expect
it
should
be
admitted
and
firmly
embraced,
though
it
were
proposed
only
as
an
hypothesis,
and
the
existence
of
Matter
had
been
allowed
possible,
which
yet
I
think
we
have
evidently
demonstrated
that
it
is
not.
134.
True
it
is
that,
in
consequence
of
the
foregoing
principles,
several
disputes
and
speculations
which
are
esteemed
no
mean
parts
of
learning,
are
rejected
as
useless.
But,
how
great
a
prejudice
soever
against
our
notions
this
may
give
to
those
who
have
already
been
deeply
engaged,
and
make
large
advances
in
studies
of
that
nature,
yet
by
others
we
hope
it
will
not
be
thought
any
just
ground
of
dislike
to
the
principles
and
tenets
herein
laid
down,
that
they
abridge
the
labour
of
study,
and
make
human
sciences
far
more
clear,
compendious
and
attainable
than
they
were
before.
135.
Having
despatched
what
we
intended
to
say
concerning
the
knowledge
of
IDEAS,
the
method
we
proposed
leads
us
in
the
next
place
to
treat
of
SPIRITS-
with
regard
to
which,
perhaps,
human
knowledge
is
not
so
deficient
as
is
vulgarly
imagined.
The
great
reason
that
is
assigned
for
our
being
thought
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
spirits
is
our
not
having
an
idea
of
it.
But,
surely
it
ought
not
to
be
looked
on
as
a
defect
in
a
human
understanding
that
it
does
not
perceive
the
idea
of
spirit,
if
it
is
manifestly
impossible
there
should
be
any
such
idea.
And
this
if
I
mistake
not
has
been
demonstrated
in
section
27;
to
which
I
shall
here
add
that
a
spirit
has
been
shewn
to
be
the
only
substance
or
support
wherein
unthinking
beings
or
ideas
can
exist;
but
that
this
substance
which
supports
or
perceives
ideas
should
itself
be
an
idea
or
like
an
idea
is
evidently
absurd.
136.
It
will
perhaps
be
said
that
we
want
a
sense
(as
some
have
imagined)
proper
to
know
substances
withal,
which,
if
we
had,
we
might
know
our
own
soul
as
we
do
a
triangle.
To
this
I
answer,
that,
in
case
we
had
a
new
sense
bestowed
upon
us,
we
could
only
receive
thereby
some
new
sensations
or
ideas
of
sense.
But
I
believe
nobody
will
say
that
what
he
means
by
the
terms
soul
and
substance
is
only
some
particular
sort
of
idea
or
sensation.
We
may
therefore
infer
that,
all
things
duly
considered,
it
is
not
more
reasonable
to
think
our
faculties
defective,
in
that
they
do
not
furnish
us
with
an
idea
of
spirit
or
active
thinking
substance,
than
it
would
be
if
we
should
blame
them
for
not
being
able
to
comprehend
a
round
square.
137.
From
the
opinion
that
spirits
are
to
be
known
after
the
manner
of
an
idea
or
sensation
have
risen
many
absurd
and
heterodox
tenets,
and
much
scepticism
about
the
nature
of
the
soul.
It
is
even
probable
that
this
opinion
may
have
produced
a
doubt
in
some
whether
they
had
any
soul
at
all
distinct
from
their
body
since
upon
inquiry
they
could
not
find
they
had
an
idea
of
it.
That
an
idea
which
is
inactive,
and
the
existence
whereof
consists
in
being
perceived,
should
be
the
image
or
likeness
of
an
agent
subsisting
by
itself,
seems
to
need
no
other
refutation
than
barely
attending
to
what
is
meant
by
those
words.
But,
perhaps
you
will
say
that
though
an
idea
cannot
resemble
a
spirit
in
its
thinking,
acting,
or
subsisting
by
itself,
yet
it
may
in
some
other
respects;
and
it
is
not
necessary
that
an
idea
or
image
be
in
all
respects
like
the
original.
138.
I
answer,
if
it
does
not
in
those
mentioned,
it
is
impossible
it
should
represent
it
in
any
other
thing.
Do
but
leave
out
the
power
of
willing,
thinking,
and
perceiving
ideas,
and
there
remains
nothing
else
wherein
the
idea
can
be
like
a
spirit.
For,
by
the
word
spirit
we
mean
only
that
which
thinks,
wills,
and
perceives;
this,
and
this
alone,
constitutes
the
signification
of
the
term.
If
therefore
it
is
impossible
that
any
degree
of
those
powers
should
be
represented
in
an
idea,
it
is
evident
there
can
be
no
idea
of
a
spirit.
139.
But
it
will
be
objected
that,
if
there
is
no
idea
signified
by
the
terms
soul,
spirit,
and
substance,
they
are
wholly
insignificant,
or
have
no
meaning
in
them.
I
answer,
those
words
do
mean
or
signify
a
real
thing,
which
is
neither
an
idea
nor
like
an
idea,
but
that
which
perceives
ideas,
and
wills,
and
reasons
about
them.
What
I
am
myself,
that
which
I
denote
by
the
term
I,
is
the
same
with
what
is
meant
by
soul
or
spiritual
substance.
If
it
be
said
that
this
is
only
quarreling
at
a
word,
and
that,
since
the
immediately
significations
of
other
names
are
by
common
consent
called
ideas,
no
reason
can
be
assigned
why
that
which
is
signified
by
the
name
spirit
or
soul
may
not
partake
in
the
same
appellation.
I
answer,
all
the
unthinking
objects
of
the
mind
agree
in
that
they
are
entirely
passive,
and
their
existence
consists
only
in
being
perceived;
whereas
a
soul
or
spirit
is
an
active
being,
whose
existence
consists,
not
in
being
perceived,
but
in
perceiving
ideas
and
thinking.
It
is
therefore
necessary,
in
order
to
prevent
equivocation
and
confounding
natures
perfectly
disagreeing
and
unlike,
that
we
distinguish
between
spirit
and
idea.
See
sect.
27.
140.
In
a
large
sense,
indeed,
we
may
be
said
to
have
an
idea
or
rather
a
notion
of
spirit;
that
is,
we
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word,
otherwise
we
could
not
affirm
or
deny
anything
of
it.
Moreover,
as
we
conceive
the
ideas
that
are
in
the
minds
of
other
spirits
by
means
of
our
own,
which
we
suppose
to
be
resemblances
of
them;
so
we
know
other
spirits
by
means
of
our
own
soul-
which
in
that
sense
is
the
image
or
idea
of
them;
it
having
a
like
respect
to
other
spirits
that
blueness
or
heat
by
me
perceived
has
to
those
ideas
perceived
by
another.
141.
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
they
who
assert
the
natural
immortality
of
the
soul
are
of
opinion
that
it
is
absolutely
incapable
of
annihilation
even
by
the
infinite
power
of
the
Creator
who
first
gave
it
being,
but
only
that
it
is
not
liable
to
be
broken
or
dissolved
by
the
ordinary
laws
of
nature
or
motion.
They
indeed
who
hold
the
soul
of
man
to
be
only
a
thin
vital
flame,
or
system
of
animal
spirits,
make
it
perishing
and
corruptible
as
the
body;
since
there
is
nothing
more
easily
dissipated
than
such
a
being,
which
it
is
naturally
impossible
should
survive
the
ruin
of
the
tabernacle
wherein
it
is
enclosed.
And
this
notion
has
been
greedily
embraced
and
cherished
by
the
worst
part
of
mankind,
as
the
most
effectual
antidote
against
all
impressions
of
virtue
and
religion.
But
it
has
been
made
evident
that
bodies,
of
what
frame
or
texture
soever,
are
barely
passive
ideas
in
the
mind,
which
is
more
distant
and
heterogeneous
from
them
than
light
is
from
darkness.
We
have
shewn
that
the
soul
is
indivisible,
incorporeal,
unextended,
and
it
is
consequently
incorruptible.
Nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
the
motions,
changes,
decays,
and
dissolutions
which
we
hourly
see
befall
natural
bodies
(and
which
is
what
we
mean
by
the
course
of
nature)
cannot
possibly
affect
an
active,
simple,
uncompounded
substance;
such
a
being
therefore
is
indissoluble
by
the
force
of
nature;
that
is
to
say,
"the
soul
of
man
is
naturally
immortal."
142.
After
what
has
been
said,
it
is,
I
suppose,
plain
that
our
souls
are
not
to
be
known
in
the
same
manner
as
senseless,
inactive
objects,
or
by
way
of
idea.
Spirits
and
ideas
are
things
so
wholly
different,
that
when
we
say
"they
exist,"
"they
are
known,"
or
the
like,
these
words
must
not
be
thought
to
signify
anything
common
to
both
natures.
There
is
nothing
alike
or
common
in
them:
and
to
expect
that
by
any
multiplication
or
enlargement
of
our
faculties
we
may
be
enabled
to
know
a
spirit
as
we
do
a
triangle,
seems
as
absurd
as
if
we
should
hope
to
see
a
sound.
This
is
inculcated
because
I
imagine
it
may
be
of
moment
towards
clearing
several
important
questions,
and
preventing
some
very
dangerous
errors
concerning
the
nature
of
the
soul.
We
may
not,
I
think,
strictly
be
said
to
have
an
idea
of
an
active
being,
or
of
an
action,
although
we
may
be
said
to
have
a
notion
of
them.
I
have
some
knowledge
or
notion
of
my
mind,
and
its
acts
about
ideas,
inasmuch
as
I
know
or
understand
what
is
meant
by
these
words.
What
I
know,
that
I
have
some
notion
of.
I
will
not
say
that
the
terms
idea
and
notion
may
not
be
used
convertibly,
if
the
world
will
have
it
so;
but
yet
it
conduceth
to
clearness
and
propriety
that
we
distinguish
things
very
different
by
different
names.
It
is
also
to
be
remarked
that,
all
relations
including
an
act
of
the
mind,
we
cannot
so
properly
be
said
to
have
an
idea,
but
rather
a
notion
of
the
relations
and
habitudes
between
things.
But
if,
in
the
modern
way,
the
word
idea
is
extended
to
spirits,
and
relations,
and
acts,
this
is,
after
all,
an
affair
of
verbal
concern.
143.
It
will
not
be
amiss
to
add,
that
the
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas
has
had
no
small
share
in
rendering
those
sciences
intricate
and
obscure
which
are
particularly
conversant
about
spiritual
things.
Men
have
imagined
they
could
frame
abstract
notions
of
the
powers
and
acts
of
the
mind,
and
consider
them
prescinded
as
well
from
the
mind
or
spirit
itself,
as
from
their
respective
objects
and
effects.
Hence
a
great
number
of
dark
and
ambiguous
terms,
presumed
to
stand
for
abstract
notions,
have
been
introduced
into
metaphysics
and
morality,
and
from
these
have
grown
infinite
distractions
and
disputes
amongst
the
learned.
144.
But,
nothing
seems
more
to
have
contributed
towards
engaging
men
in
controversies
and
mistakes
with
regard
to
the
nature
and
operations
of
the
mind,
than
the
being
used
to
speak
of
those
things
in
terms
borrowed
from
sensible
ideas.
For
example,
the
will
is
termed
the
motion
of
the
soul;
this
infuses
a
belief
that
the
mind
of
man
is
as
a
ball
in
motion,
impelled
and
determined
by
the
objects
of
sense,
as
necessarily
as
that
is
by
the
stroke
of
a
racket.
Hence
arise
endless
scruples
and
errors
of
dangerous
consequence
in
morality.
All
which,
I
doubt
not,
may
be
cleared,
and
truth
appear
plain,
uniform,
and
consistent,
could
but
philosophers
be
prevailed
on
to
retire
into
themselves,
and
attentively
consider
their
own
meaning.
145.
From
what
has
been
said,
it
is
plain
that
we
cannot
know
the
existence
of
other
spirits
otherwise
than
by
their
operations,
or
the
ideas
by
them
excited
in
us.
I
perceive
several
motions,
changes,
and
combinations
of
ideas,
that
inform
me
there
are
certain
particular
agents,
like
myself,
which
accompany
them
and
concur
in
their
production.
Hence,
the
knowledge
I
have
of
other
spirits
is
not
immediate,
as
is
the
knowledge
of
my
ideas;
but
depending
on
the
intervention
of
ideas,
by
me
referred
to
agents
or
spirits
distinct
from
myself,
as
effects
or
concomitant
signs.
146.
But,
though
there
be
some
things
which
convince
us
human
agents
are
concerned
in
producing
them;
yet
it
is
evident
to
every
one
that
those
things
which
are
called
the
Works
of
Nature,
that
is,
the
far
greater
part
of
the
ideas
or
sensations
perceived
by
us,
are
not
produced
by,
or
dependent
on,
the
wills
of
men.
There
is
therefore
some
other
Spirit
that
causes
them;
since
it
is
repugnant
that
they
should
subsist
by
themselves.
See
sect.
29.
But,
if
we
attentively
consider
the
constant
regularity,
order,
and
concatenation
of
natural
things,
the
surprising
magnificence,
beauty,
and
perfection
of
the
larger,
and
the
exquisite
contrivance
of
the
smaller
parts
of
creation,
together
with
the
exact
harmony
and
correspondence
of
the
whole,
but
above
all
the
never-enough-admired
laws
of
pain
and
pleasure,
and
the
instincts
or
natural
inclinations,
appetites,
and
passions
of
animals;
I
say
if
we
consider
all
these
things,
and
at
the
same
time
attend
to
the
meaning
and
import
of
the
attributes
One,
Eternal,
Infinitely
Wise,
Good,
and
Perfect,
we
shall
clearly
perceive
that
they
belong
to
the
aforesaid
Spirit,
"who
works
all
in
all,"
and
"by
whom
all
things
consist."
147.
Hence,
it
is
evident
that
God
is
known
as
certainly
and
immediately
as
any
other
mind
or
spirit
whatsoever
distinct
from
ourselves.
We
may
even
assert
that
the
existence
of
God
is
far
more
evidently
perceived
than
the
existence
of
men;
because
the
effects
of
nature
are
infinitely
more
numerous
and
considerable
than
those
ascribed
to
human
agents.
There
is
not
any
one
mark
that
denotes
a
man,
or
effect
produced
by
him,
which
does
not
more
strongly
evince
the
being
of
that
Spirit
who
is
the
Author
of
Nature.
For,
it
is
evident
that
in
affecting
other
persons
the
will
of
man
has
no
other
object
than
barely
the
motion
of
the
limbs
of
his
body;
but
that
such
a
motion
should
be
attended
by,
or
excite
any
idea
in
the
mind
of
another,
depends
wholly
on
the
will
of
the
Creator.
He
alone
it
is
who,
"upholding
all
things
by
the
word
of
His
power,"
maintains
that
intercourse
between
spirits
whereby
they
are
able
to
perceive
the
existence
of
each
other.
And
yet
this
pure
and
clear
light
which
enlightens
every
one
is
itself
invisible.
148.
It
seems
to
be
a
general
pretence
of
the
unthinking
herd
that
they
cannot
see
God.
Could
we
but
see
Him,
say
they,
as
we
see
a
man,
we
should
believe
that
He
is,
and
believing
obey
His
commands.
But
alas,
we
need
only
open
our
eyes
to
see
the
Sovereign
Lord
of
all
things,
with
a
more
full
and
clear
view
than
we
do
any
one
of
our
fellow-creatures.
Not
that
I
imagine
we
see
God
(as
some
will
have
it)
by
a
direct
and
immediate
view;
or
see
corporeal
things,
not
by
themselves,
but
by
seeing
that
which
represents
them
in
the
essence
of
God,
which
doctrine
is,
I
must
confess,
to
me
incomprehensible.
But
I
shall
explain
my
meaning;-
A
human
spirit
or
person
is
not
perceived
by
sense,
as
not
being
an
idea;
when
therefore
we
see
the
colour,
size,
figure,
and
motions
of
a
man,
we
perceive
only
certain
sensations
or
ideas
excited
in
our
own
minds;
and
these
being
exhibited
to
our
view
in
sundry
distinct
collections,
serve
to
mark
out
unto
us
the
existence
of
finite
and
created
spirits
like
ourselves.
Hence
it
is
plain
we
do
not
see
a
man-
if
by
man
is
meant
that
which
lives,
moves,
perceives,
and
thinks
as
we
do-
but
only
such
a
certain
collection
of
ideas
as
directs
us
to
think
there
is
a
distinct
principle
of
thought
and
motion,
like
to
ourselves,
accompanying
and
represented
by
it.
And
after
the
same
manner
we
see
God;
all
the
difference
is
that,
whereas
some
one
finite
and
narrow
assemblage
of
ideas
denotes
a
particular
human
mind,
whithersoever
we
direct
our
view,
we
do
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
perceive
manifest
tokens
of
the
Divinity:
everything
we
see,
hear,
feel,
or
anywise
perceive
by
sense,
being
a
sign
or
effect
of
the
power
of
God;
as
is
our
perception
of
those
very
motions
which
are
produced
by
men.
149.
It
is
therefore
plain
that
nothing
can
be
more
evident
to
any
one
that
is
capable
of
the
least
reflexion
than
the
existence
of
God,
or
a
Spirit
who
is
intimately
present
to
our
minds,
producing
in
them
all
that
variety
of
ideas
or
sensations
which
continually
affect
us,
on
whom
we
have
an
absolute
and
entire
dependence,
in
short
"in
whom
we
live,
and
move,
and
have
our
being."
That
the
discovery
of
this
great
truth,
which
lies
so
near
and
obvious
to
the
mind,
should
be
attained
to
by
the
reason
of
so
very
few,
is
a
sad
instance
of
the
stupidity
and
inattention
of
men,
who,
though
they
are
surrounded
with
such
clear
manifestations
of
the
Deity,
are
yet
so
little
affected
by
them
that
they
seem,
as
it
were,
blinded
with
excess
of
light.
150.
But
you
will
say,
Hath
Nature
no
share
in
the
production
of
natural
things,
and
must
they
be
all
ascribed
to
the
immediate
and
sole
operation
of
God?
I
answer,
if
by
Nature
is
meant
only
the
visible
series
of
effects
or
sensations
imprinted
on
our
minds,
according
to
certain
fixed
and
general
laws,
then
it
is
plain
that
Nature,
taken
in
this
sense,
cannot
produce
anything
at
all.
But,
if
by
Nature
is
meant
some
being
distinct
from
God,
as
well
as
from
the
laws
of
nature,
and
things
perceived
by
sense,
I
must
confess
that
word
is
to
me
an
empty
sound
without
any
intelligible
meaning
annexed
to
it.
Nature,
in
this
acceptation,
is
a
vain
chimera,
introduced
by
those
heathens
who
had
not
just
notions
of
the
omnipresence
and
infinite
perfection
of
God.
But,
it
is
more
unaccountable
that
it
should
be
received
among
Christians,
professing
belief
in
the
Holy
Scriptures,
which
constantly
ascribe
those
effects
to
the
immediate
hand
of
God
that
heathen
philosophers
are
wont
to
impute
to
Nature.
"The
Lord
He
causeth
the
vapours
to
ascend;
He
maketh
lightnings
with
rain;
He
bringeth
forth
the
wind
out
of
his
treasures."
Jerem.
10.
13.
"He
turneth
the
shadow
of
death
into
the
morning,
and
maketh
the
day
dark
with
night."
Amos,
5.
8.
"He
visiteth
the
earth,
and
maketh
it
soft
with
showers:
He
blesseth
the
springing
thereof,
and
crowneth
the
year
with
His
goodness;
so
that
the
pastures
are
clothed
with
flocks,
and
the
valleys
are
covered
over
with
corn."
See
Psalm
65.
But,
notwithstanding
that
this
is
the
constant
language
of
Scripture,
yet
we
have
I
know
not
what
aversion
from
believing
that
God
concerns
Himself
so
nearly
in
our
affairs.
Fain
would
we
suppose
Him
at
a
great
distance
off,
and
substitute
some
blind
unthinking
deputy
in
His
stead,
though
(if
we
may
believe
Saint
Paul)
"He
be
not
far
from
every
one
of
us."
151.
It
will,
I
doubt
not,
be
objected
that
the
slow
and
gradual
methods
observed
in
the
production
of
natural
things
do
not
seem
to
have
for
their
cause
the
immediate
hand
of
an
Almighty
Agent.
Besides,
monsters,
untimely
births,
fruits
blasted
in
the
blossom,
rains
falling
in
desert
places,
miseries
incident
to
human
life,
and
the
like,
are
so
many
arguments
that
the
whole
frame
of
nature
is
not
immediately
actuated
and
superintended
by
a
Spirit
of
infinite
wisdom
and
goodness.
But
the
answer
to
this
objection
is
in
a
good
measure
plain
from
sect.
62;
it
being
visible
that
the
aforesaid
methods
of
nature
are
absolutely
necessary,
in
order
to
working
by
the
most
simple
and
general
rules,
and
after
a
steady
and
consistent
manner;
which
argues
both
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
God.
Such
is
the
artificial
contrivance
of
this
mighty
machine
of
nature
that,
whilst
its
motions
and
various
phenomena
strike
on
our
senses,
the
hand
which
actuates
the
whole
is
itself
unperceivable
to
men
of
flesh
and
blood.
"Verily"
(saith
the
prophet)
"thou
art
a
God
that
hidest
thyself."
Isaiah,
45.
15.
But,
though
the
Lord
conceal
Himself
from
the
eyes
of
the
sensual
and
lazy,
who
will
not
be
at
the
least
expense
of
thought,
yet
to
an
unbiased
and
attentive
mind
nothing
can
be
more
plainly
legible
than
the
intimate
presence
of
an
All-wise
Spirit,
who
fashions,
regulates
and
sustains
the
whole
system
of
beings.
It
is
clear,
from
what
we
have
elsewhere
observed,
that
the
operating
according
to
general
and
stated
laws
is
so
necessary
for
our
guidance
in
the
affairs
of
life,
and
letting
us
into
the
secret
of
nature,
that
without
it
all
reach
and
compass
of
thought,
all
human
sagacity
and
design,
could
serve
to
no
manner
of
purpose;
it
were
even
impossible
there
should
be
any
such
faculties
or
powers
in
the
mind.
See
sect.
31.
Which
one
consideration
abundantly
outbalances
whatever
particular
inconveniences
may
thence
arise.
152.
We
should
further
consider
that
the
very
blemishes
and
defects
of
nature
are
not
without
their
use,
in
that
they
make
an
agreeable
sort
of
variety,
and
augment
the
beauty
of
the
rest
of
the
creation,
as
shades
in
a
picture
serve
to
set
off
the
brighter
and
more
enlightened
parts.
We
would
likewise
do
well
to
examine
whether
our
taxing
the
waste
of
seeds
and
embryos,
and
accidental
destruction
of
plants
and
animals,
before
they
come
to
full
maturity,
as
an
imprudence
in
the
Author
of
nature,
be
not
the
effect
of
prejudice
contracted
by
our
familiarity
with
impotent
and
saving
mortals.
In
man
indeed
a
thrifty
management
of
those
things
which
he
cannot
procure
without
much
pains
and
industry
may
be
esteemed
wisdom.
But,
we
must
not
imagine
that
the
inexplicably
fine
machine
of
an
animal
or
vegetable
costs
the
great
Creator
any
more
pains
or
trouble
in
its
production
than
a
pebble
does;
nothing
being
more
evident
than
that
an
Omnipotent
Spirit
can
indifferently
produce
everything
by
a
mere
fiat
or
act
of
His
will.
Hence,
it
is
plain
that
the
splendid
profusion
of
natural
things
should
not
be
interpreted
weakness
or
prodigality
in
the
agent
who
produces
them,
but
rather
be
looked
on
as
an
argument
of
the
riches
of
His
power.
153.
As
for
the
mixture
of
pain
or
uneasiness
which
is
in
the
world,
pursuant
to
the
general
laws
of
nature,
and
the
actions
of
finite,
imperfect
spirits,
this,
in
the
state
we
are
in
at
present,
is
indispensably
necessary
to
our
well-being.
But
our
prospects
are
too
narrow.
We
take,
for
instance,
the
idea
of
some
one
particular
pain
into
our
thoughts,
and
account
it
evil;
whereas,
if
we
enlarge
our
view,
so
as
to
comprehend
the
various
ends,
connexions,
and
dependencies
of
things,
on
what
occasions
and
in
what
proportions
we
are
affected
with
pain
and
pleasure,
the
nature
of
human
freedom,
and
the
design
with
which
we
are
put
into
the
world;
we
shall
be
forced
to
acknowledge
that
those
particular
things
which,
considered
in
themselves,
appear
to
be
evil,
have
the
nature
of
good,
when
considered
as
linked
with
the
whole
system
of
beings.
154.
From
what
has
been
said,
it
will
be
manifest
to
any
considering
person,
that
it
is
merely
for
want
of
attention
and
comprehensiveness
of
mind
that
there
are
any
favourers
of
Atheism
or
the
Manichean
Heresy
to
be
found.
Little
and
unreflecting
souls
may
indeed
burlesque
the
works
of
Providence,
the
beauty
and
order
whereof
they
have
not
capacity,
or
will
not
be
at
the
pains,
to
comprehend;
but
those
who
are
masters
of
any
justness
and
extent
of
thought,
and
are
withal
used
to
reflect,
can
never
sufficiently
admire
the
divine
traces
of
Wisdom
and
Goodness
that
shine
throughout
the
Economy
of
Nature.
But
what
truth
is
there
which
shineth
so
strongly
on
the
mind
that
by
an
aversion
of
thought,
a
wilful
shutting
of
the
eyes,
we
may
not
escape
seeing
it?
Is
it
therefore
to
be
wondered
at,
if
the
generality
of
men,
who
are
ever
intent
on
business
or
pleasure,
and
little
used
to
fix
or
open
the
eye
of
their
mind,
should
not
have
all
that
conviction
and
evidence
of
the
Being
of
God
which
might
be
expected
in
reasonable
creatures?
155.
We
should
rather
wonder
that
men
can
be
found
so
stupid
as
to
neglect,
than
that
neglecting
they
should
be
unconvinced
of
such
an
evident
and
momentous
truth.
And
yet
it
is
to
be
feared
that
too
many
of
parts
and
leisure,
who
live
in
Christian
countries,
are,
merely
through
a
supine
and
dreadful
negligence,
sunk
into
Atheism.
Since
it
is
downright
impossible
that
a
soul
pierced
and
enlightened
with
a
thorough
sense
of
the
omnipresence,
holiness,
and
justice
of
that
Almighty
Spirit
should
persist
in
a
remorseless
violation
of
His
laws.
We
ought,
therefore,
earnestly
to
meditate
and
dwell
on
those
important
points;
that
so
we
may
attain
conviction
without
all
scruple
"that
the
eyes
of
the
Lord
are
in
every
place
beholding
the
evil
and
the
good;
that
He
is
with
us
and
keepeth
us
in
all
places
whither
we
go,
and
giveth
us
bread
to
eat
and
raiment
to
put
on";
that
He
is
present
and
conscious
to
our
innermost
thoughts;
and
that
we
have
a
most
absolute
and
immediate
dependence
on
Him.
A
clear
view
of
which
great
truths
cannot
choose
but
fill
our
hearts
with
an
awful
circumspection
and
holy
fear,
which
is
the
strongest
incentive
to
Virtue,
and
the
best
guard
against
Vice.
156.
For,
after
all,
what
deserves
the
first
place
in
our
studies
is
the
consideration
of
GOD
and
our
DUTY;
which
to
promote,
as
it
was
the
main
drift
and
design
of
my
labours,
so
shall
I
esteem
them
altogether
useless
and
ineffectual
if,
by
what
I
have
said,
I
cannot
inspire
my
readers
with
a
pious
sense
of
the
Presence
of
God;
and,
having
shewn
the
falseness
or
vanity
of
those
barren
speculations
which
make
the
chief
employment
of
learned
men,
the
better
dispose
them
to
reverence
and
embrace
the
salutary
truths
of
the
Gospel,
which
to
know
and
to
practice
is
the
highest
perfection
of
human
nature.
